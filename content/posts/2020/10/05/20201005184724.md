How have you been this spring?  

If you don't record it, you seem to forget it. It would be nice if you pause for a moment to learn about the little moments and write them down.  

At the Book Therapy Workshop in May, we write 'Haruchi Spring' like the book [Momoon Moil]. This spring was particularly difficult, but there are days I lived while keeping my daily life. In a friendly atmosphere, we will look back on this spring together and write in my own language. You will be able to discover your own uniqueness while looking at ordinary everyday life in a special way.  

It was written in honor of an ordinary day. There were many times I wanted to shine, but I observed the moments that did not shine, the unusual things that lingered in that time, and the patterns of my heart. If life consisted of one percent of brilliance and ninety-nine percent of mediocrity, I decided to love ninety-nine percent of mediocrity. The mediocrity is special. As long as we find the quince hidden in it, the ordinary is special. As if the moon that rises every day is a special night.
