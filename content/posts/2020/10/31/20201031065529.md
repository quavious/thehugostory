Soon summer. I wondered if the ever-changing spring would continue, but I was confused about the summer when I suddenly encountered it one day before the season of arrival. I think it's summer again, such as when I discover a white cloud in the sky I look up at, when I discover a darker green color, when I think of Ice Americano as a temple.  

Even though it's not really summer yet, some worry early this year that we don't know whether we can keep up with the pace of this season. Nevertheless, in this season full of vitality that I don't know for some reason, it would be nice to grow up blue and green, but I think it would be okay if it wasn't.  

It was always me who was impatient, not the time.
