Corona 19 nightmare  

The number of corona 19 confirmed in Korea has exceeded 1,000.  

Boogie, who reads the news every day, is also upset.  

The 'black sugar jellyfish chips' that Boogie recently released is also not being sold.  

No, the company's products are not sold.  

People aren't coming to the store and sales aren't coming out.  

Boogie is upset when I think,'The product I made is ruined..'  

But the situation is the situation, so I can’t help it  

I am upset, but I give up.  

Sales and performance.. Even when you think about this,  

When I think of those who are working hard to prevent the spread  

I think this is also a sound of fullness.  

It is like when I saw such a tired picture, I also feel my heart hurt.  

Even if you forget Corona and work hard,  

I’m envious of those who work from home,  

The bookkeeping company is not working yet  

I am sorry.  

My mind changes again when I see the way home and the busy streets.  

The consumer economic index is also gradually falling, and if you look at the stores of the difficult self-employed,  

Just because your body is healthy now and that you work perfectly well  

I also think that I am grateful for the heart of blessing.  

In many ways, both body and mind are difficult now..  

I hope this situation ends ㅠㅠ  

(Through personal hygiene!)
