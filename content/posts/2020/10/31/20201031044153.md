A gaze on philosophy  

As soon as you hear the word'philosophy', there will be many people who feel a thorn in their ears. It is natural that the philosophers learned during the basic curriculum were only strange words, and the philosophy I heard in the liberal arts class was only the sound of eating dog grass, which was far from my life.  

However, is real philosophy a science that tells a story that is far from everyday life?  

All philosophers have told stories that are far from everyday life. However, it is not the essence of philosophy to only discuss such difficult topics. Rather, the data that left their own answers to everything they encounter in their daily life would be a more accurate explanation.  

In the philosophical gaze of everyday life, the opinions of philosophers are briefly summarized on topics that can be experienced in various daily lives, and the author's opinions are carefully added. I start writing with the hope that the readers will recognize that philosophy is not a difficult discipline through very light subjects, but that it is just a discipline that nurtures diverse perspectives on the world.
