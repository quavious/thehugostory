Spring is here again in 2020.  

This year, you can see the mountains on each other back and forth  

Clouds are also swimming in the sky.  

Because of the fine dust that dominated the sky day after day  

It is a great gift to remember last spring, when the clouds disappeared for a long time.  

Maybe the time when the clouds disappeared  

A year later, suggesting the current coronavirus outbreak  

It must have been a warning message to us.  

I went there every spring.  

The cherry tree was showing off its swollen white breasts,  

No one had full access.  

Corona-19 was crossing the road and blocking it.  

When I had to turn away from death,  

Even in front of an embankment that blocks a stream  

Fish heading upstream to climb the high stairs of Eodo  

You may have just gone back after doing a breathtaking jump.  

Like we miss our ordinary everyday  

Fish was long ago when a ferry crossed the river  

Under a bridge made of wooden posts  

You may miss the waterways that have been free to go.  

Now that frozen daily life staggers,  

The tears shed by countless lives of pale faces beyond our lives  

Listen and turn your eyes.  

And the sky like this refreshing gift now  

What kind of message are you sending us?
