1. Love yourself. You can never be happy compared to others.  

Comparison is the seed of misfortune. A healthy sense of inferiority can be a stepping stone for growth, but if you compare even a small thing with others and blame yourself for your shortcomings, you will inevitably become far from happiness.  

2. Do not skimp on the writing experience.  

Don't spare the money you spend on meeting someone, listening to education, visiting new places, learning something special, and eating a variety of foods. What others hear and know is knowledge, but what you experience and feel is wisdom.  

3. Be grateful for your little routine.  

It is better to have a habit of feeling grateful rather than complaining about reality. There are a lot of happiness around us when we look for close friends who can talk without adding or subtractively when we have concerns, grateful juniors who tell us that we are very lucky to meet seniors, and the time to see the bright cherry blossoms on our way to work. Don't sacrifice the present for a better future. The most important thing is whether I am living with happiness in my life right now.
