Memories of the day I took a philosophy class  

Considering the trajectory of the day, the appearance of the two of us shone with a strange aura.  

He was a person like a cool morning breeze that came to me in the middle of the summer, and I was like a person like a shower that suddenly came to him in the middle of the summer.  

I thought that my life had taken the relatively easy option of living just leisurely and ordinary, following the wind, following the trajectory of my life. However, it was the moment when I began to believe that everything would be new because of this person who walked into my life when he advised me to take a walk, saying, "Will you be at home on such a good day?"  

Suddenly, the fresh feelings of the words he unintentionally expressed with a sincere face made me feel as fresh and sorrowful as the feeling of hanging the stem by the window and blooming flowers in the air.  

Waiting for a reply, I responded to the invitation to his daily life by pulling out a nice hat from the closet with a short saying "I can't do that".
