If the darkness is getting long enough to think it's too much, close your eyes. And think. The Milky Way that fills the night sky. The light from the stars. A beautiful moment that unfolds before your eyes. Many scenes that were sometimes thought to be imaginations and mirages are comforting in difficult moments. The important thing is to talk to your inner self. Going through the process of asking and answering how happy you want your life to be and how bright you are. If it's a life that's possible, walking through a dark tunnel would be a little less lonely.
