Potato fields this winter and May last year  

The hills of this winter and the hills of May last year  

The hill photo taken in May last year is one of the daily walking paths. I like that photo because it feels like an old hardship. Actually, it's not a very uphill road to call it a hill. There are several plum trees past that place. When you smell it, it exudes such a scent that goes into your mouth through your nose.  

The potato field is like a river until the buds grow. The sunlight shatters on the plastic and it overflows like water. The season is measured by planting potatoes and radish.  

Two pots placed side by side. A pot is mainly used for small amounts, and a large pot is used when a lot of burned things accumulate.  

On the right is the table from last May. There is a winter when dry flowers and stones come up between the seasons when food and buckets come up.
