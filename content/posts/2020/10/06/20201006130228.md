I accidentally went to a bookstore and saw a book.  

Daily look 365, created by #style advisor hana, who coordinates simple clothes simply and effectively.  

I was thinking, 'Because I became an old woman, I think I forgot how to dress well..'  

It seemed to help the sense of wearing clothes that I lost somehow.  

So, I'm going to try to coordinate with something in the book.  

Will it be a daily life that pleases me a little bit tired of child-rearing and work?
