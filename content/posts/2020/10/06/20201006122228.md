Today is  

It is a scenery that feels nice, fresh and beautiful.  

The everyday scenes that I always saw on my morning walk  

Feel different  

Corona has changed a lot of things  

Social distancing, room corner challenge, big steamer, etc.  

A new coined word appeared  

Korea's wealthy ranking has also changed  

That changed daily life  

I am living in a world that is taking place  

Even if a new drug is developed, the daily lives we keep  

It won't change much  

All i can do  

Wearing a mask and keeping distance  

Are you buying  

Something becomes dull  

Start to get confused
