Good April, I went on a business trip to Tokyo. I used to bring one book for each business trip, and at this time, I picked up a book I read quite a few times, [Record of All Days]. I thought this book was suitable because it is good to read when I am relaxed, and it is good to read to have time when I am busy. I read it so many times, and put it on a white bed sheet, and it looked sloppy.  

One of the great things about going on a business trip is that you can start the day with my favorite blue bottle coffee.  

During the first free time I had after work, I ate dinner at the restaurant Yasube. The first time I ate Tsukemen.  

Character goods from illustrator Himaa that I met at the BEAMS store. The more I look at the pictures of his unique ideas on Instagram, the more curious he becomes. I bought a pair of shoes here.  

As I wandered around downtown Shinjuku, the raindrops fell a little. On my way back to the hotel, I ended the day with a can of Suntory Highball.
