The preciousness of everyday life that we didn't know  

Even taking the subway  

Even taking a town bus  

Even going to the neighborhood super casually  

Even meeting friends  

Even going to a cafe and chatting  

Even going anywhere on the weekend  

I just knew how precious our daily lives are, and through the corona, I learned the importance of those little things.  

Through being unable to meet anyone other than the family for a while  

The fact that humans are really social animals,  

The truth that we cannot live alone  

I felt like a bone.  

I miss Hae-cheol Shin today.  

Hear his song "Invitation to Everyday".  

When you go for a walk, drink tea, read a book, or think about it,  

I think something is empty these days.  

I am now  

I think I need someone.  

When you meet friends, make phone calls, and stay awake all night,  

I keep thinking of you  

I feel you everywhere at all times  

Today I want to invite someone to my daily life  

Like this like that  

I am in thought.
