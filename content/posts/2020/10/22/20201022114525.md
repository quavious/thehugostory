I now want to apply lipstick that was not well applied even if I had a lot of cosmetics in the case. It's been a while since I haven't seen my face brightening with a single lipstick. What I didn't do because it was annoying, I think I can wear it really well now, but nowadays, when I go to the convenience store in front of my house, a mask is essential, lipstick has just become useless. The overfit jacket that my husband bought a few weeks ago has nowhere to go, and the expensive bag is now a mana item.  

If I go out in front of my house because I have a business to do, I feel that spring has come from the flowers blooming on the street. Even though I was just feeling good for a moment, I suddenly became sad in reality, and the sadness was comforted again by the blue sky with flowers.  

The usual routine that I had just been without, sometimes even getting sick of it. I found out when I was stolen.  

Actually everything is  

That it was a special happiness...
