I was so tired today. From morning to morning, German classes, community meetings, and meetings with former company representatives overlapped one after another, making it hard to come to my senses. After the schedule is over, it's 5:30 p.m.  

I used to ride my bike when I went home because I was working out these days, but today I was mentally tired and sitting in a cafe during the meeting, but it was so hot without air conditioner, so I just took the subway without thinking about going home. So one stop before I got home, I was sitting by the window and dazed, and the checkers seemed to be burning. I thought you were checking the tickets, and I was sitting there with no worries because I brought my transportation card, but I was looking at the clock for a moment. 5:45. I completely forgot. The regular ticket I am purchasing is part-time, so I can't take the subway during the day, but I can't use it from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., which is the time to leave work.  

In Korea, I always paid for transportation at that time and had a hard time adjusting because I had never used a season ticket. Last year, there were times when I tried to get on the bus at that time because I mistook the time and couldn't get on the bus, and there were times when I was barely caught by a checker when I got out of the subway. After overcoming several crises, I adjusted last year, but after coming back from Korea at the end of the year, the Korona Lockdown exploded, so I guess I completely lost my touch again because I had to suspend my regular ticket for a while. Rather, they can take a bus in advance, so if you forget to take it, you can't take it, so you can't take it, but if you want to take a subway in Germany, you can pay a fine. If I had thought about it, I would have run away as soon as I saw the checker, but I was dazed and caught him by the neck.  

Soon after, I arrived at the station where I got off, but the checker didn't return my passport because he was checking someone else. There was someone else caught besides me. It was a man. Both followed the station worker down. He said he forgot the time, and so did I. There seemed to be many others besides us. I asked for an ID card. For the first time since I came to Germany, I had to show my passport and visa at a place other than the airport. I watched the station worker blankly writing down the number, name, and address on my visa on a palm-sized machine. I was glad that I forgot my passport and visa. Would something bigger have happened if I forgot about this, too? When asked how much the fine was, he said, "usually" 60 euros. The exchange rate these days is about 84,000 won. Saying "normal" seemed to give room for negotiation. I really didn't have money, so I thought I'd cut it if I cried, but I didn't even have the energy to do that, so I just returned with a fine. They told me to make an account transfer within a month or pay it at the service center. Phew  

Hamburg's subway system is very difficult, and the time limit for daily tickets is a little different from what we think, so people who are new or new are often confused. In the past, my acquaintance's younger brother also said that he paid a fine because he got caught in the subway on his way to the airport without thinking about the time. Normally, subway stations are free because there are no machines or people to inspect, but one day, checkers suddenly appear. When that happens, my heart flutters even if I have a ticket. I wonder if I bought something wrong or if I'm going to be criticized. But I was so worn out today that I didn't have a heart to shrink, but I forgot the time. Phew.  

It was such a waste of 60 euros that suddenly flew away in a difficult situation. If you had just sat at a cafe for 20 more minutes and didn't have to run to get on the subway, or if you had gotten a little more alert and figured out the time and bought a ticket, the do-dol ticket would keep floating in your head.  

On my way home, I soothed myself several times. No one is to blame.I chose to take the subway, and I just forgot the time.Nevertheless, I kept feeling unfair for some reason.I looked into his mind, thinking, "Is that something that would make him cry?"The truth is, I was so embarrassed because I think I was caught in my bank account, which is now reeling from 60 euros.  

But it doesn't help at all.There is no change in crying over why this happens at this time of year. Since I didn't pay for a temporary suspension for two months during the Korona Lockdown anyway, it was enough to think of it as transportation fee that would have gone out if it weren't for Corona, and after paying a certain fine, I would wake up and never get confused again. I felt good and comforted.  

If you have to pay for it, it means you have to pay for it.I've decided not to indulge in such trifles.Still, as I write, something comes to my mind again.  

Today's event will just be an episode to laugh and reminisce about someday. I believe that this is just one of the passing processes.
