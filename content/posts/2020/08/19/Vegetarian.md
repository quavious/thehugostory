It was the end of the interview in a friendly atmosphere.  

"Lastly, Bongbong, if you have any questions or comments for the company, please do so.  

By the time I worked for the first company for two years, I had the opportunity to grow up in a better-conditioned company, and I had the final interview with the CEO.  

"Ah... Mr. President, but I do vegetarian."  

I wonder if there was a moment of silence. The CEO went on speaking.  

"Oh, I see. By the way, our company is a livestock company, is that okay with you?"  

Yes, the company I applied for is related to livestock (but I can't tell you in detail, so I'll let you know this much.) I was a vegetarian, and I applied to a company that was very closely related to meat.  

"I don't mind."  

"It's a livestock company, and you're applying. How did you get to apply?"  

"I think the company has a clear goal of improving livestock animals so that they can live happily ever after. That's exactly what I'm aiming for."  

As many of you may have seen in my writings, "Children of Meat House, Start Vegetation," I started vegetarianism after realizing that killing and eating animals is too cruel for animals. But some might think it was contradictory to apply for a livestock company.  

I don't want everyone to eat meat like me. To be honest with you, I think it would be nice if everyone would be vegetarian. However, it is difficult to change the eating habits that have been eaten for a lifetime, and considering the livelihood of the workers involved in the livestock industry, I think it is difficult to get rid of meat immediately. So, I thought, what can I do at this point?  

'Let's at least let the livestock live in a place other than the stuffy cage like now. Let's not get killed when we're sick, let's let them live where we can get treatment.’  

That's how I applied.  

In conclusion, I got accepted to this company and I am currently working as a team leader. When the CEO and the board decided to hire me as a vegetarian, they changed the restaurant to an in-house restaurant with many foods I could eat before I joined the company. At the company dinner, vegetarian dishes are prepared without me having to say anything. I'm very grateful.  

A staff member told me this.  

Thanks to Bongbong, I think it's good to know how a vegetarian lives. It's good to eat vegetarian food that I've never tried before...And sometimes, I think it's good to have a chance to eat properly.  

This article wasn't originally planned, but I suddenly wrote it because I thought I should write it after seeing the feedback from my last article.  

My life style cannot always be the same as many decisions in this age and society. I can always be a minority and when my lifestyle is a minority (this is not only vegetarian), the behavior of revealing my lifestyle and orientation can be both tactful and uncomfortable. However, I have to reveal my way of life so that people can understand me. There are many people who understand me more than I thought. I don't know until I tell you what I think. The first attempt is difficult, but the second and third expressions will be easier than the first.  

Not only vegetarians, but also those who read this in a place where various beliefs and values can be encountered, I conclude with the hope that they will be able to express their thoughts and be respected.  

@I try to update every Sunday.
