The role of the second husband in his in-laws, who had only two sons, was more like a daughter. If his wife, who is blunt and makes the family uncomfortable with her existence alone, takes care of the family affairs and plays the role of the eldest son who has the right to inherit, she only did what her husband told her to do and brighten the family atmosphere. Then it changed slightly the year before the incident.  

The incident began when her mother-in-law and her mother-in-law suddenly took care of her. Of course, it is good for children to take care of their parents. However, it was a problem because he was ordering people around him to take care of him, not his own. For example, "Mom, I heard you're having an event today, so please go with someone." It was like, "You're going to be frustrating, so someone take you for a drive." And if the person so named (?) refuses to do so, we have become unfaithful to our mother-in-law, and she has become a filial son. It's a strange logic, but it was.  

That's how things started that day. It was almost 8 p.m., so I got a call from my parents.  

"We started a little while ago. Mom, I'll take you to your house and we'll go to the hospital."  

Your mother-in-law is coming. I won't tell you why. If my privacy level comes first and I use it, the comments will go crazy.)  

Until then, I had never expressed disgust at such a sudden visit because he was a husband who recognized that his mother and brother were strange but did not allow him to say NO about his in-laws' work. But that day, I couldn't hide my embarrassment and disgust.  

I, who was not good at organizing things, had to be exhausted for a few days because I literally cleaned the house when my mother-in-law came. I threw it away rather than cleaning it up. My mother-in-law said, "I'm teaching because I'm a family member, but I'm teaching because I'm a parent," and she nagged me from the refrigerator to the closet. I literally didn't have time to put my butt on the floor because I was cleaning the house where my mother-in-law was pointed out for three meals a day. Well, you can hide it if you're visiting for a while, but if you stay for a week, there's nowhere to hide. If your mother-in-law is so neat that she points out how you live, it's not to that extent. However, I don't clean my own house, but when I go to someone else's house, I can only see dust.  

In this situation, it was less than a week after I started my current job that year, so the inside of the house was literally. But I didn't even think about cleaning it up because my mother-in-law was coming in three hours later. Moreover, when I thought that my mother-in-law would search everywhere in an empty house with only children after I went to work, I was more than irritated and gloomy. Nevertheless, I couldn't complain to anyone, so I was just saying, "Be as you please." "I'll get insulted." On that day, her husband, who had been complaining about his mother, stepped up. With the change in the role of Siaju-bu and her husband, her mother-in-law was so-called longing for her husband, and her husband was annoyed by such a brother-in-law and her mother-in-law.  

Why would your mother come to such a thing? How could you leave so suddenly without saying anything? My wife's going out to work.  

But Shiazouver was adamant. What's wrong with going to work? Are you going to someone else's house? Contact your family in advance.  

So offended by each other, my mother-in-law came and the next day I roughly set the table for the side dishes in the refrigerator and went to work. In the past, I would have had a hard time setting up a breakfast table with my mother-in-law, had breakfast with her mother-in-law, or would have woken up my children and sat them at the table with their mother-in-law, but on that day, I would have protested my mother-in-law's sudden visit with my husband's support. My mother-in-law, who was offended by her first treatment, died at home with my wife before I left work. I didn't feel at ease. In spite of all the circumstances, the water was already spilled, although I felt uncomfortable all the time whether I have done better.  

Each individual has his or her own domain and has his or her own line to follow. Some people, however, cross the line without the other's consent. It is very tiring to maintain a relationship with such a person. It's natural to cross the line if you don't know if I'm ignoring you even if you're telling me not to cross the line. It's because I get angry even if I tell you a story. Most of those people justify crossing the line by saying, "What do you think about family?" or "between us. However, no matter how close they are, even if they are family members, if they cross the line not to cross the line, they will always have problems. Let's not rationalize crossing the line by saying "because we're family" or "because we're close." The closer a relationship is, the more accurate it is to follow the line. It is important to know that keeping good means different from having no affection. Safety lines are also essential in human relationships.

And before the Lunar New Year's Day, this incident became a trigger and an incident broke out that would haunt me until now and forever.
