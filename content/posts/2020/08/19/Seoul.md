"I'm sensitive to smell!"  

My husband is a soldier by profession.  

They wear the same long-sleeved military uniform in the middle of summer and in the winter." (In winter, there is an overcoat.)  

One day, I was surprised to see my husband wearing a long-sleeved shirt in the summer when I saw him preparing to go to work.  

"You don't have military uniforms for the summer? Why don't you have a short-sleeved uniform?"  

I was surprised by the uniform without summer dragon. The soldier said it was because short-sleeved sleeves were more dangerous than long-sleeved ones because they were always prepared for war. If there is a war in the summer, the long sleeves that were rolled up should be worn down again.  

Throughout the four seasons, one long-sleeved uniform is folded in summer and spread out in winter. Now that I think about it... There are not many clothes in my husband's closet. Just a bunch of uniforms. My husband's closet was definitely full, but I didn't have any clothes to wear when the seasons changed.  

It was the day I used up the baby detergent.(When children were young, adult detergents were so strong that they bought and used baby detergents separately.) Just in time, adult detergents fell off, so I was looking for a detergent that could be used with a child as a single detergent. I was looking for a detergent that has good price and needs to see its ingredients and its capacity.  

"Oh! An eco-friendly laundry detergent without microplastics?"  

"Can I use it with confidence?"  

"You can use it 1,100 times on a single purchase?"  

"Chem, carcinogens, microplastics, environmental hormones, residual detergents?"  

"In addition, laundry works well."  

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I have to buy this!!!!!!  

I was suspicious of the visuals I've never seen before, but the reviews were good and the prices were reasonable.  

And if you use a laundry ball with an order for a laundry ball, you don't need any fabric softener, so I sent it to my neighbor who said he would use the remaining fabric softener.  

The washing ball looks really amazing. There are ceramic balls in the shape of a perforated ball. The principle is that ceramic balls in the washing bowl produce far-infrared wavelengths, causing wavelength energy to vibrate water to weaken the bond of time, thus removing dirt from laundry.  

In fact, when I heard that the chemicals in the detergent were bad for my skin, I put only a small amount of laundry in it, but I was relieved in this respect. Even if you do the laundry every day, you can use the washing ball for three years, which is economical because it saves on detergent costs. It is convenient and beneficial to the environment because it is washed only with water and washing balls without powder or water detergent.  

I've been using this strange-looking urchin-like washing ball at my house.  

It happened during a rainy season.  

It was a day when the laundry was less dry in the damp weather.  

I don't know if he's this sensitive to the smell of detergent. I knew that day. (After using up the detergent, I didn't talk about changing it to an eco-friendly laundry ball. At first glance? My husband rarely turns the washing machine around, so I told him to call me when he does the laundry, and I always put in two laundry balls and did the laundry.)  

"Didn't you put the detergent in? The laundry doesn't smell good~~"  

"It's good to have no smell. My house won't use detergent anymore. Ta-da! Look at this! This is the eco-friendly washing ball. It looks amazing, doesn't it?  

At this time, I didn't see it. Your husband's disappointment.  

In fact, I was proud to use eco-friendly detergents by myself and began to explain it to my husband. I thought my husband would like it because it was for my family and for the environment. I knew you'd compliment me for doing well. But that was a big miscalculation.  

"Why do you change it? I'm the one who's important to smell good in the laundry!"  

It's been a while since I changed to a laundry ball, but I was surprised to hear that. And on the one hand, I was sad.  

"What, you changed it to a laundry ball because you liked it? It's for my family."  

I never dreamed I'd be sensitive about this kind of thing. In the meantime, he didn't smell good Downy in his uniform, so he thought, "Ah, the Wi-Fi must have forgotten to put it in." And he said he forgot to ask for it.  

Listening to my husband, I understood.  

"I'm a sweaty person. You have to fold your long sleeves in midsummer, and you can't even change your sweaty clothes all day long. I hope the clothes smell good, not my sweaty smell. "  

Yeah, he's a sweaty guy.'  

At that time, with pride, I couldn't say sorry. Actually, I was sorry. I didn't think that far because I was crazy. Somehow, one day, I smelled perfume in the room where my husband left for some reason. My husband is a man who values good smell.  

No matter how much I live in my house, my husband's opinion was also important.  

I'm sorry husband, but I'll make sure to ask your opinion from now on. But... I can't give up the laundry ball,  

Finally, through a lot of searches,  

I found a way to make up for these shortcomings, where the use of laundry balls leaves no scent in the laundry.  

Husband, I'll give you a nice scent in your uniform.~~
