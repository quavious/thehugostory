Jay and Wannie like to roll around on the floor and run around on the sofa (it's a secret that they like to scratch, too). But most of all, children like sunshine the most. Of course, after my beloved butler.  

The noon, when the sun comes in long, is the perfect time to go out to the veranda together and get some sleep. If you open the veranda door that you didn't care about because you overslept, you can go straight out and enjoy the sun slowly.  

Sitting on a cushion, you can relax and grovel on your belly and legs touched by sunlight, or you can lie on your back on a bright floor-and-go-roll. Then I blink my eyes and fall asleep.  

They are regular customers of sunny restaurants.  

It's a veranda that I painted vaguely when choosing a newlywed house, but it can't be so good when I see children enjoying the sun to their heart's content these days. It's as if it existed for the children from the beginning. I think I did a good job insisting on the veranda at that time.  

Sometimes I just stare at the window. The leaves twinkling according to the light, the bird sitting on the branches of the tree and chatting, and the sight of the man turning his head in search of the bird at the sound.  

Even in the house, if the position of the daily objects changes even a little bit, they inhale curious noses with great caution. How new is the scene that birds and people see for the first time in their lives, and the leaves swaying without rules?  

I sat for so long. It's very warm when you pet the bodies of the children who came into the living room. It's like the little sunshine that has the brightness of the mother's year.  

The sunshine is in low spirits these days. This is because it has been a long time since the rainy season without exception has been prolonged. Even if you open the veranda door, you often go out for a while and come in soon. Veranda without the sun is a steamed bun without Angkko.  

It's okay to be hot at times like this, so I hope there will be a sunny day soon. A good weekend, if you fill me up with brunch, and then you go out to the veranda, put the kids in both sides and close your eyes...  

I feel like I'm in a joke!Haha
