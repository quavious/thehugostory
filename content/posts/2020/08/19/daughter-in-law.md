I got to move to a new apartment by collecting money hard. We had a loan, but we were so happy to have our nest. And isn't it a new apartment?  

Preparing to move like that!  

The phone rang! It's my mother!  

Mother: It's Sunmi. It's me. You're moving, aren't you? How's the move preparation going?  

Na: Ah...your mother.  

Mother: Sunmi, tell your mom to raise the rent for the house downstairs where you live now.  

Ask him to add the money to you guys. I hear the rent has gone up a lot these days.â€œ  

Na: ....  

I heard the sound of water over the phone.  

Na: Mother... What are you doing?  

Mother: Your father is doing the laundry.  

My father-in-law suffered a stroke twice.  

But when I was doing my father's laundry, I didn't know you had a problem with our money.  

I couldn't say anything.  

I thought, "Oh, it's starting again.'  

To my husband who was next to me.  

Na: My mother must have thought of our money problem while doing her father's laundry!  

Husband:....  

Na: Please tell your mother to stop talking about the money.  

Why is she telling me to go and jujube for what she's going to do?  

Isn't your house and my house all the same? Why do you keep asking me to help you at home?  

When did I ask my mother for money?  

My husband had no day.  

And we moved.  

When I first got into debt, I was in a hurry and I was so sad and scared to pay interest.  

Because at that time, the term 'housepure' continued to appear in the newspaper.  

one day  

I got a call from my eldest brother. While I was talking about this and that with my brother, there was talk about loans.  

Then I told my eldest brother about my mother's sorrow.  

Na: Your mother keeps asking us to help her by raising the rent for her house.  

Brother: Yeah? That's possible.You guys live better than my house!  

Na: Brother! If you live well in my house, would you like to work so far?  

If Minseo (brother's daughter) gets married and Minseo's mother-in-law tells Minseo that, would you like it?  

Brother: So you want me to try it?  

And Olke doesn't think of my mom as her own.  

If you thought my mom was your mother, you shouldn't have done this to her, right?  

Na: That's not the sound!  

We had such a big argument.  

My husband, who left work, said, "Sunmi... Why did you do that again?"  

Na: Why are you talking like this without even listening to me? Who said that first?  

Husband: Because I know your personality. I heard you did it like you wanted me to do it to you.  

My eldest brother called not only my husband but also my mother to talk about my phone conversation. However, words are completely wrong depending on how the speaker speaks.  

So everyone in my in-laws understood that I said to my brother, 'You too,' and all the arrows turned to me.  

What did I do wrong?  

I just wanted to get an understanding. I knew you would understand my mind because you were my daughter-in-law.  

But that was my miscalculation. My brother was a daughter before he was a daughter-in-law.  

I just wanted this word from my brother."Sunmi, you're so... Why would she do that? You untie it."  

I wanted to hear this remark, but I realized from then on that I was greedy.  

And I chose. I'm just gonna stay still.  

My in-laws caught my husband, not me, starting with "How can you say that to your superiors?" and "How can you?"  

That's how a week passed, and I got a call from my mother.  

"Sunmi, I understand everything. You could fight like that! But you can't use it if you do that to him. Can't you call my brother and apologize? If you do that, I will treat you better! Sunmi, do me a favor."  

I couldn't help but do this mother's favor.  

And she always says, "I'll do better!"  

I believed that word. No, I think I wanted to believe it.  

But my mind still goes, "What on earth did I do wrong?"  

"I'm sorry, brother. That's not what I meant."  

After that I began not to tell anyone in my in-laws my innermost feelings.  

My in-laws are just in-laws and I no longer have any wishes or expectations for them.  

But I was a man's wife, and I couldn't live away from my husband's house, so I was doing my best as a daughter-in-law.  

Then one day, I found out that my second daughter, Se-in, was deaf.  

The sky fell, and I wailed. Went through the days of self-criticism, wailing at the discovery too late.  

I hated everything when the public found my hearing loss. The same was true of the new house.  

I hated the house at the thought of finding hearing loss in this house. So I decided to sell the house.  

And my in-laws who went down on Chuseok...
