The bathroom ceiling plywood would rot. A wooden lathe in the bathroom. Why is the towel rack so low? That's how you do it. Hurry up and sell your house and leave.  

They said no before seeing it. But I think the reason why carpentry, tile, and equipment owners say no is because no one does it. It was because we had to explore the possibility and devise new ways.  

Mr. Woodman, I'd like to finish the bathroom ceiling with paint on the plywood. Can I have a plywood! Mr. Tile, could you cross-construct the wall tiles? Equipment owner, the towel rack is waist-high! I'm going to put a wooden shelf under the mirror, here and there.  

Standards, standards, and practices in the interior industry that would have been completed over a long period of time, added and shriveled for work efficiency. Much of what we were trying to do was going against them. I never meant to embarrass them on purpose, but it was natural for them to be troubled by our fresh request. But rather than regret later, I wanted to push ahead with it as I wanted. It'll work somehow. Furthermore, the bathroom was one of the spaces that could never be abandoned with the kitchen.  

  

The wooden lathe also heard the sound of what a tree was in the bathroom, but the oak tree was cut to fit the bathroom and finished with oil stains and varnish to make it a plausible shelf. I may have been a thorn in my side when I didn't listen to my bosses, but that didn't mean that I didn't care about everything I believed in. That's the corner of trust that little window in my bathroom. May the light and wind come in and out of the cupboard-sized hole; may the damp bathroom be crispy.  

  

After many twists and turns, the day the bathroom was completed, I shuddered, saying, "I can sleep with a blanket here." From the height of the towel rack, the direction of the tissue rack, and a few carefully installed wall hangers, everything was a space that resembled Yeon-yi's lifestyle. It was easier to find the part we were not involved in. How did the bosses in charge of our bathroom meet such kids like us and suffer so much? I didn't feel comfortable playing the role of a disobedient rebel, but now that I think about it, I think I did well to become a rebel. If it weren't for their help, my bathroom wouldn't be what it is, but on the contrary, if I had changed my plan as they advised, I would have regretted not having done as I wanted.  

As I wish, the book-standable window in my bathroom is doing my part well. The light and wind barely dries up the moisture quickly, making the bathroom soft, and the plywood ceiling and oak tree shelves are the same even a year later. So you'll know what it is once you try it. Experts don't make sense at a hundred percent chance, nor does a person who doesn't know anything about interior design make any sense. Rather than being right or wrong, it's more important to know who lives in the house. Things like the tastes, lifestyles, and thoughts of a living person. Even a person who violently cleans his face by spraying water everywhere, or a person who cleans his face without splashing a drop of water, can be a decisive consideration. Just because the toilet should not have trees that are weak in moisture doesn't mean everyone has to adjust to it. It's enough if we don't splash a lot of water when we wash our face.
