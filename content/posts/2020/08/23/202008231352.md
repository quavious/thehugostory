A series of long-planned appointments have been canceled.  

It was a difficult appointment because of Corona 19...  

Seeing my favorite friends is a dead end. I feel drained.  

My daily routine, which is only quiet, is also gradually falling apart in the aftermath of Corona.  

Far from eating out, it is also prudent to go shopping at a local store.  

Above all, it is painful that I can't go to the cafe comfortably.  

(It's my only outing as a stay-at-homebody...)  

Can I go down to see my mom in September?  

My chest feels stuffy.
