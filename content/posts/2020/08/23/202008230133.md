When I was tired or having a hard time, I thought about this, that, and all kinds of thoughts came to mind. Of course, those ideas gave positive energy to work harder, but they also resulted in negative feelings that it was hard to get a clear result even if I worked so hard.  

But I don't have any worries these days. Not only do you feel tired or tired, but you don't have any thoughts. I think the comfort that comes from everyday life has made this life happen. Without thinking, I go to work when the morning is bright, eat when I'm hungry, go home when it's dark, and wash up when I'm sleepy.  

Of course, I know that keeping this complacent routine is not helpful in the future, but I don't hate this life.  

Sometimes it's good to be complacent and give your body and mind a break. He left himself to the flow of time without thinking.
