Embarrassed, he once gave an in-house lecture on "planned thinking" to juniors.  

Personally, I think creative planning begins with 'suspicion'.  

the scrupulousness of not taking things for granted;  

the slackness of looking at the phenomenon at a reasonable distance;  

The stubbornness of not giving up on the thought of "but, just in case," even if everyone says so.  

Here  

Even doubts about myself constantly repeating whether I really know what I think I know now.  

You're wary of the unconditional overconfidence that comes from past experiences.  

The illusion of knowledge and information should not be regarded as a firm judgment.  

He said that he was quite naughty in front of his juniors.  

What is work, what is life?  

And what is living well?  

Maybe it's because I'm halfway across the line this year.  

Maybe it's because of the sky in Seoul where we've had a rainy season.  

I've already heard about things that I thought were a little bit organized before.  

Doubts rise again.  

It's really hard to plan my daily life properly.
