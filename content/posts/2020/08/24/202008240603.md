Sit on the opposite side of the flowing valley and iron the meat with a net."Flap" fish are naturally caught along the flowing waves.It's natural. What's not natural is making every day special about the heavy rain.Every day is being audited.Did the Earth want to tell you this?Children are happy whether or not they are happy.Â There is nothing to do with nature and play.The enemy is just bored...I became friends with a tomato T-shirt friend. I was 4 years old. I was happy.  

These days are full of small thanks.
