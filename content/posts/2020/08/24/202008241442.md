"A good mom to me, a bad mom for Kang Tae-han."Hi, tree! Good morning!" 'Kogildong is an adult.' #He's a psycho, but it's okay #Moon Sang-tae  

My favorite character these days.The condition is strong and firm. He seems to be afraid of conflict, but he knows how to solve it better than anyone else. bump into, think, understand, express sincere apology He is a commendable man who knows how to carry out and grow this simple route. The deep affection for his younger brother behind his clear attitude of public and private affairs also touches the heart. Draw a picture, sign a contract, want to get a camping car for down payment, and live with my brother in that camping car. The desire to take responsibility for his younger brother with his own ability without anyone's help makes the drama colorful, which can be grayish. So I feel. That he is a man with the power to face an indelible trauma. And that conviction alone gives me comfort and support in life. It is an effect and healthy energy that only condition can give. He's the most trustworthy character I've ever met. Condition doesn't say anything wrong. So, a real adult. I learn life by looking at the state of things at every moment.
