Why aren't you picking up when you're just giving it to me?  

I made a credit card a few days ago. I got rid of all the cards I had because I didn't have any income, but I made a new card purely because of the event. If 100,000 won is spent within 10 days of the new issuance, the 100,000 won will be returned in cash. It used to be an event that I had never stood up to before, but it was different now. Why aren't you picking up this big money if you're just giving it to me? I soon pressed the application button.  

But I didn't know. It is not a simple process for a person without a certain income or property to receive a credit card to press the application button in the Internet window and enter the address. The next day, a phone call came from the credit card company.  

"Do you have a job at the momentarily.  

"Oh, well, it's a part-time job."  

"Do you earn more than one million won?"  

(Unexpected shame) No....”  

"Oh, then do you have an installment savings account of more than 3 million won?"  

"Yes, there is."  

"Which bank are you at?"  

"Nonghyup."  

"Are you a local agricultural cooperative or a Nonghyup Bank?"  

"You mean the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation? It's a local agricultural cooperative."  

"Oh, yes. You can't do local agricultural cooperatives.. Then you can get it issued as a tenant, if your home deposit is over 10 million won."  

"Yes, but is it possible for a joint name to exceed 10 million won?""(Am I supposed to go this far?)"  

"Well, I'll ask the team leader about that and call you back in a moment."  

"Yes, you are. (I just hope you don't get a call.)  

After a while.  

"Customer, you can have a joint name. Please take a photo of the lease and send it to us, and we'll review it and let you know if we can issue it."  

next day  

"I can't check the attached file, but I think it's because the file size is too big. I was wondering if you could adjust it and..."  

That afternoon.  

"Customer, I'm calling because the file hasn't been confirmed yet."  

In the midst of this, I hesitated to cancel it several times. But the credit card company was more patient than me. In the end, I ended up overcoming the annoyance and the pressure, saying, "Let's do it until the end."  

I've done this.  

The card was delivered two days later. Now, the key was to scrape 100,000 won within 10 days. Since it was a car that had a bad back again, I decided to get treatment at the rehabilitation medicine department that I had attended a year ago. As I tried to make a reservation in a hurry, I didn't have the right time with the therapist, so I needed to make a phone call several times, but the reservation was made safely. On the day of treatment, I took a bus to go to the hospital. I used to go to the place before moving, so it took two hours to go back and forth by bus and I had to transfer once in the middle, but that's no big deal. You can also read a book that you've read while listening to and reading audio books on the bus.  

When I got off near the hospital, I searched my wallet just in case. Whoa. No way. There was no card. He mistook the color of his card because he had several check cards and ID cards stuck inside his small card wallet. Oh, my gosh. I was too lazy to give up 100,000 won, and I said, "I've done this much." I didn't want to buy things that I didn't need to pay 100,000 won, so I immediately crossed in the opposite direction and waited for the bus. I got off the bus for another hour. He ran home with a short-term goal of less than 30 minutes of transfer time and a long-term goal of 100,000 won. Then find the card and run back to the station. The bus came just in time to pity me running through the abyss of stupidity with my shaky legs. I contacted the hospital about ten minutes late, and arrived exactly that late for treatment.  

After treatment, the shiny new card safely completed the first payment. 103,000 won on the receipt. That's it. In a month, 100,000 won will be refunded to my account. Yes, I was a slave to capitalism, always complaining about capitalism and the principles of a market economy. An ant that is so simple that you can't even feel tired of being proud to finally use a credit card without mistakes.  

Within a social structure that cannot be easily changed, I am digging my own small nest of ants. From the perspective of the financial world, he takes a shovel to live as an independent worker on a road where credit is not guaranteed and the future is not socially guaranteed. This is one of the 'sabbing'.  

I don't think it's a waste of time.  

Until what I want to do becomes money, what can I do to make a profit? In fact, such worries are endless. With the idea of making my favorite fashion Hanbok myself, I applied for the Hanbok Technician's National Expense Training Course not long ago. But after watching the increasingly deteriorating condition of the neck and waist, I realized that it was a challenge to apply for the process of sitting down and bowing all day for four months. I called the vocational school to cancel the application and thought about using two job sites to make corrections and inquiries. I've been doing essay writing and correcting self-introduction letters of college entrance exam takers for a long time, but I was also not confident in myself trying to promote it myself. There is a limited amount of energy in which a person can document and look at a piece of writing in a day, but it is true that such physical strength and time are not enough to use only for writing. If you pass the interview with Bonn a few days ago, you will be trained in media content including video editing for a while from next month.  

My goal is to do what I like, and what I do to move on to that goal shouldn't hurt my goal. But it's not easy to keep your balance. Because I don't want to spend time with the state and wealth inverted like before, I become very careful when choosing a new job. And it's tempting if it can help with living expenses, such as events and secondhand sales.  

But I don't want to worry about it seriously. It will be the same as any time in life that the future is unknown. In his twenties, he did everything he could to get his hands on, without seeing anything in front of him. Back then, he overcame a greater sense of hopelessness with the spirit and guts unique to youth. And now in his late thirties, he has enough experience to beat frustration and loss. They know that there is a belief that a person will somehow survive if he or she has a will, and that if he or she goes forward with that faith, the situation will help me. I've been holding out and hiding for a while, and I've seen everything I've been doing well.  If it doesn't work, I'll catch a cockroach. Two-thirds of the requests for an errand app were asked to catch cockroaches that appeared in their own rooms. Luckily I'm not afraid of bugs.)  

These days, I think it would be a waste of money if I get a refund after a month.  Make up your mind and spend it on something you can't spend in your usual tight living expenses. I think I'll try a luxurious perm. The perm, which used to be a half-price event when Corona's momentum was severe, is almost being released. I used to do it when I had medium-length hair, but my hair was moderately longer, so I'm going to do a "hippi perm" this time. Make your scalp as curly and curly as possible. an independent worker with a hippopotamus I think it suits you well. And until the strong waves are in a mess, I will live my life as a voluntary unemployed, writer-wandering, and translator-wandering. Writing poems about the environment and the things in the gaps, there may be more small paths that stretch in a slightly different direction in the giant ant caves I live in.
