Buy one serving of food ingredients without plastic bags  

Three days ago, I had to eat zucchini from home and I decided to make a stew full of vegetables by saving my stamina. I went to the mart with my fabric pouch. It was the first day since he made his own declaration not to bring plastic bags into the house. It was important not to use plastic bags, but the unexpected difficulty I felt on that day was buying food ingredients for just one person. If there were potatoes, an onion, and mushrooms in a pack, I was going to buy them, but more than half of them were successful.  

For onions, there were two options. A small net containing more than five onions, and two trimmed onions are wrapped in a styrofoam support. I don't cook often, but if I buy five, it would probably go bad, so I chose a trimmed one. There was no word that he would take off his wrap and leave styrofoam behind. The potatoes were able to be picked up and weighed on the scale and printed out price tags without difficulty.  

Of all the mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms can be weighed. When I picked one up and asked the employee to weigh it, he responded embarrassedly, saying, "It's too light to weigh." While I was trying a few times, my mind became so heavy that I finally succeeded in printing it! It was fortunate that the reaction was the same as it was difficult because it didn't weigh properly, rather than asking why they didn't use plastic.  

I think that the reason for stepping into this world (?) was obviously not just guilt about environmental destruction. I felt irritated while washing the dishware of the delivery food I ordered inadvertently, but I gave up folding, which is the basis of the arrangement, and the bags I put in the plastic bag stand of Ikea (Barriera) overflowed and filled my toes. That kind of "no" ideas piled up one by one and finally exploded.  

Not long ago, when I heard the sound of heavy rain and heard the laundry from the damp laundry basket, I found another plastic bag that had flowed from the cleaner's, and I felt like I was going to suffocate from the bottom of my heart. The tragic conclusion is that I can't stand it anymore and that I should stop using plastic. Tired of plastic bags, this time coincided with this summer when climate change was dramatically approaching. If he loses his mind a little bit, he will get rid of the vinyl that appears in various parts of the room and reduce the cost of throwing away garbage by reducing delivery food.  

So far I have always regretted putting plastic in for a little convenience. For example, if you order a lunch box, you will get a pile of recycled waste, and if you want to throw it away, you will have to wash it off and separate it, so there is no process of preparing food, but it is the same as taking care of it. So I decided to stop delivering less money and less trash, but I couldn't resist the temptation of a convenient system that took in warm rice with a few finger moves. I turned on the delivery app soon.  

If you think about where you get a lot of vinyl other than delivery food, it was definitely related to eating. Usually, people don't receive envelopes when they buy something, but when they buy food, they can't put potatoes with dirt and carrots in their bags, so they had no choice but to use plastic rollback at the mart. I thought I could greatly reduce the amount of vinyl in my house just by reducing this.  

The declaration, which is serious by itself, may soon become something that never happened, or may repeat giving up and starting several times. But in the meantime, I think I'll be able to spend the rest of my life with a few less plastic bags and less worry about throwing them away. If I do well for a certain period of time, I would like to make a different habit so that less trash can occur, if not to zero-waist.
