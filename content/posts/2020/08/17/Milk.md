Various beverages made using soybeans, grains and nuts have recently become popular as substitutes for milk. These drinks, which are not milk but savory and nutritious like milk, are called "vegetable drinks" or "alternative milk." A full-food "milk," which was considered essential food for growing children's growth and bone health, is being replaced by a growing number of products that are easily available at supermarkets and are being used instead of milk at coffee shops.  

  

  

Last but not least, the name. Promote and sell with the word 'milk or milk' for consumers to understand. However, the dairy industry is protesting that these products have nutritional value similar to milk, which could cause confusion to consumers. The EU had already ruled in 2017 that the name 'milk' should not be used for some non-mammal products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that you use neutral expressions such as 'Drink or Beverage,' and that Korea, too, does not display or advertise deceiving consumers on the basis of 'Article 8, Clause 5 of the Food Labeling Advertising Act.'  

Academics still have mixed opinions about whether cow milk or vegetable milk is better. But for those who value health reasons and personal beliefs, alternative milk will be a great choice. Alternative milk with its unique taste and rich nutrition is thought to show a steady growth trend around the world. In the past two weeks, I've tasted a total of 13 alternative types of milk. Previously, I had purchased products without much thought, but after carefully checking the ingredients and nutrients and savoring the taste properly, I could see what really suited me. Consider the pros and cons of each alternative milk and choose the best product for yourself!  

Soy Milk* Good: Soy Milk, a typical vegetable milk, contains the most similar nutritional ingredient to cow milk. Most products enhance calcium and vitamins, especially since they contain 7 to 10 grams of protein per cup of soy milk, similar in content to cow milk. Also, a natural chemical called isoflavone, which is contained in soy milk, is known to reduce the risk of heart disease.* Bad: People who are allergic to soybeans, the main ingredient of soy milk, must be careful. Also, GMO is also cited as a problem with soy milk, which is mostly imported soybeans. It is true that GMOs are generally made for the convenience of increased production or distribution/procession, and are unhealthy for long-term consumption. Let's check if you used domestic beans when choosing soy milk!  

  

Almond Milk* Good: Almond Milk is characterized by lower calories than other alternative milk. Almonds are rich in insoluble dietary fiber, which is known to be effective in preventing constipation or colorectal cancer, and vitamin E, which is known to suppress unsaturated fatty acids and free radicals that help prevent cardiovascular disease. * Bad: But the protein content per cup of almond milk is very low, about 1g, and should be taken with food that can fill it. Also, it is recommended that you choose a product that has these ingredients enhanced because they do not contain other nutrients such as vitamins and minerals.  

  

Coconut Milk* Good: Coconut milk, which is widely used in cooking and dessert baking, is good for those who want something creamy and sweet. Soy-free, gluten-free, can be a good choice if you are sensitive to allergies.* Bad : High in calories compared to other alternative milk and contains very little protein, about 1g per cup. Above all, it contains a lot of saturated fatty acids, so you should pay attention to eating the right amount.  

  

Oat Milk* Good: Oat Milk is currently the most trendy alternative milk, and oat is a grain that has recently become a "superfood" for modern people due to its abundance of protein and dietary fiber. It is quite full and has a soft and light texture. * Bad: Carbs and calories are higher than other alternative milk. It is higher in protein than other alternative milk, but less than soy milk or cow milk.  

  

Cashew Milk* Good: One of the most notable alternative milk products of late, low in calories and containing dietary fiber, antioxidants, magnesium, etc. It has a very creamy and rich flavor, which is good for adding to coffee or tea, especially the L-theanine ingredient contained in green tea is known to enhance it. * Bad: It has very low protein content, such as almond milk, so it is recommended to drink with a meal full of protein.  

  

Rice Milk* Good: Completely free from all sorts of allergies and lactose intolerance and is the least irritating alternative milk. It has a relatively low fat content, and is comfortable to drink with a neutral flavor and light texture. * Bad: Relatively high carbohydrate content and lower protein and calcium content. It is not good for cooking or baking because it has a very thin texture.
