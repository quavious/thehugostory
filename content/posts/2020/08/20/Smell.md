There's one thing I'm surprised and don't understand when I'm married, and it's kind of ritualistic behavior that I'm still doing 15 years into marriage.  

When he came home from work, the first thing he did was to take off his socks and smell them.  

No, I couldn't understand why I smelled every day when I came back from working all day would naturally smell his feet and sweat. When he takes it off, he says to just put it in the washing machine right away, but he always goes into his room, sits in his desk chair, takes off his socks, smells them, and then puts them in the washing machine.  

When I asked my husband why he smelled it, he had to come home and smell his socks to say, "Oh, you've worked hard today. "You finished your day well." It feels like you're organized and ready mind.  

When I heard that, I thought, "I see. It was like an important ritual for him to end the day.' I understood the behavior and began to look good.  

And I never got to nag about the action again.
