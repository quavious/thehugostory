One day I asked my brother.  

Why do you like tteokbokki?’  

'Cause it's delicious.  

So why is it delicious? Pork cutlet is delicious and tteokbokki is delicious. I eat tteokbokki three times a week, but I only eat pork cutlet once a month.'  

For a moment, she replied, pondering.  

First of all, tteokbokki goes well with everything. I put in ramen noodles, dip in hot dogs, and leave out fried food. But it's delicious.'  

You're right, it's perfect if you just put it in.  

I've never seen anyone who doesn't like tteokbokki. At least not around me. Then let's describe tteokbokki. When I see a long, chewy rice cake in a red sauce, my mouth is watering. In addition, the sauce is sweet, spicy, salty, sour, and does it all alone. Fish cakes are added to this, and it smells like the sea. How did the green onion stick to the rice cake? There is no end to it in expression. The default value of tteokbokki is complete.  

I also like tteokbokki. Since I heard that the biggest enemy of dieting is tteokbokki, I have refrained from eating it once or twice a month, but the more I suppress it, the more I think of it.  

There was an aquarium in front of my elementary school. It is funny, but tteokbokki was more famous than fish. During school hours, all the children ran out and lined up in front of the aquarium, and I ate tteokbokki every day, which costs 300 won per cup. I used to wait for the bus while chatting with my friends while eating tteokbokki in a paper cup with a long toothpick. The generous owner also sold 150 won to children who had no money. I still remember it as the best tteokbokki flavor of my life. Even the tteokbokki that I ate at a famous restaurant can't beat the aquarium tteokbokki.  

I also sold tteokbokki at the university cafeteria I used to go to. The main character of lunch time was Tteokbokki at a snack bar rather than at a school cafeteria. It was so popular that it was sold out in the morning two or three times a week. (Women students eat tteokbokki in the morning.) Graduates suffering from morning sickness came to visit. When they packed instant and retorot foods and left for Qatar, about 30 percent of their luggage was for tteokbokki. Even as a flight attendant, I always locked the door after checking whether chopsticks, cup noodles, and tteokbokki were embedded in a large suitcase the day before the flight.  

roam around a beautiful but strange city He came into the hotel late in the evening and poured hot water into cup noodles and tteokbokki, waited for a while to thank the inventor of the retro food. I can't believe you can eat tteokbokki a few thousand kilometers away. He chewed the chewy rice cake, shook off the nightmare he had met on the flight that day, and engraved the emotions of the new city. I chewed as hard as I could with all my emotions like a rainbow-colored sauce.  

One Saturday morning, I was walking fast toward yoga and found a long line. Since when has my neighborhood been this hot? It's just a neighborhood with a few shops in an apartment, easy to find anywhere. It is not a place where famous restaurants are located in Itaewon or Garosu-gil. It's just a real neighborhood alley. While walking along, wondering if there was a pharmacy, many people were lined up in front of a tteokbokki store that looked less than 10 pyeong. I understand. Would I have wanted to eat tteokbokki even if I died? Turns out it was a famous snack bar that came from far away. It takes an hour from Seoul to visit a one-pyeong tteokbokki restaurant in this corner and stand in a long line. The day reminded me of tteokbokki in the middle of yoga training. (The training was ruined.)  

What would it taste like? I think it'll be very stimulating if you look at the election.It'll be a little sweet, right?No. Is it really spicy?I can't do this.  

Just now, he moved his legs diligently at an incredible speed that the trained man could not believe, and headed for where the line had been. Sure enough, we've already sold out and closed the door. I've got a chill has formed. After a few days, I chose some free time on weekdays and went to eat tteokbokki. Me and my brother shouted at the same time.  

'This tastes like aquarium tteokbokki!'  

Having grown up eating the aquarium tteokbokki all six years, my younger brother and I used to compare it to the taste of the aquarium whenever we visited a famous tteokbokki restaurant. It's been more than 10 years since we last bought it, but the taste is still valid in our memory. I had to fight against the sudden surge of longing while eating the tteokbokki, which was very similar to the aquarium tteokbokki. I'll give you the right answer. Then I became curious. When will Koreans start eating tteokbokki? From the time when I went in and out of the school gate with a yellow name tag on my chest to the time when I was angry, stressed, happy and overwhelmed. Maybe Tteokbokki has memories. It is certain that they often describe a delicious tteokbokki restaurant as 'the taste they used to have in front of school.'  

The sky road is blocked. No, all roads are blocked and overflowing. Let's eat tteokbokki because I'm depressed. At times like this, you should eat sweet, spicy, and salty tteokbokki. Life is so tteokbokki.
