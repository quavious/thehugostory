Banks work in circulation. So at the end of each year, the old man leaves for another branch and a new employee comes. However, only the bank's security guards remain the same. Because we don't have a circular shift. So I couldn't help but express my respect when I heard that there were people who worked at a branch for more than 10 years. Bankers are also at one point for as little as 1-2 years. There was an old employee at the branch I was in. He joined the bank, worked for four years at the first branch he was assigned, and was now looking for five years. He was a man in his 30s who was similar to me. When it was lunchtime, we always ate together. We ate together for a year but I couldn't get along with him. It felt like there was something in sight on the wall. He said he was about the same age, but I was older than him. Maybe that's why. He had never come near me in a moment. Of course, I didn't want to get close, either. Because he was like a person from a different world than me.  

He always worked hard. Worked harder than anyone else, even better. So I got a lot of awards and got promoted fast. Five years after joining the company, he was sectioned, and all bank employees across the country knew him. This is because he was the top seller of credit card companies in the credit card sector. He sold credit cards to customers every day. And sold well. Especially, the bank where I was at sold a lot of credit cards to grandmothers and grandfathers because there were many elderly people. Of course, I would recommend it to all the other guests. He always seems to have thought about how to sell well. Because his hair was always tangled when the bank was closed. Thanks to him, he was on a roll with recognition. When I saw him like that, I thought. What makes him work so passionately? There are people who could just get a decent salary, but he wasn't at that level. So I asked once while eating. Why do you work so hard? Then he replied.  

"I've just lived a little. I think that's why I'm obsessed with hard work."  

Is it a habit to live hard? Living without him won't make everyone work hard, but I didn't understand his answer. There had to be something more special. Because I didn't live so hard like him. That would not have made my house so rich, nor would it have made his house so poor. I don't even know if I was comparing myself to him. In fact, I thought in my mind even though I was not the object of comparison. What would he think of me? Maybe they think it's pathetic. I'm working as a bank security guard at this age. I also thought that I might have thought foolishly or might not understand because my job is a bank security guard and writing something that I can't make money. This is all my delusion. In fact, what he thinks of me is neither so important nor how to know. It doesn't matter if you think so. However, the harder he lived, the more I felt that I became more and more intimidated.  

One day, this happened. I came to work and there was an unknown employee. Is that why you're a new employee? I thought so, but it's not a new employee, is it a year? I'm a second-year employee, and I'm here to learn how to sell credit cards from another branch to the branch I' So the new employee stuck behind him and carefully wrote down how to sell them. Should I say that he is a model to others? The branch manager always adored him for not missing the first place every time.  

The branch I was at had a pretty frequent get-together. Each time he used to be quite drunk. The branch manager liked to drink, so he often drank with the branch manager and got drunk. He always called me brother when he was drunk. He came close to me saying let's drop the honorifics, but the title was changed to "Master" again the next day, as if it had been the case, and he used the honorifics again. It makes some sense. He's not so high up at the branch, he's younger than himself, and he's older. It must have been somewhat inconvenient. Perhaps if I were younger than him, could we get along a little?  

He was transferred to another branch after a year and left. Having been at the branch for five years, he was quite intimate with visiting guests, and the guests liked him, too. So the guests who heard the news of leaving brought him a present. I think the customers liked it because I worked hard. In particular, he named the grandmother soondae. Grandmother Sundae was particularly disappointed. Leaving, he left behind a short letter to the remaining guests. There are times when he leaves and sometimes his news comes through. There are times when his name is mentioned when employees talk to each other. "She won first place this year, right?" That's great." The new recruit said he saw him. I went to get training for new employees and he said he came and gave a lecture. He will still be working hard, doing his best. I sometimes felt sorry for him and sometimes I admired him. Have I ever done my best for something like him? Perhaps he will remain the way he is now even if he is promoted and elevated in position. Sometimes I think. If I met him in private, not in my workplace, I wondered if I could have talked more deeply. I hope he is always well.
