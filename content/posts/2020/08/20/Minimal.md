The first year of newlyweds.  

  

The honeymoon is in Europe.  

I got married without a wedding ring, skipping all comas, gifts, and preliminaries.  

We don't need it. I skipped all the things that were considered, so I had nothing to do.  

Instead, I spent my money on things I wanted to enjoy.  

I spent more than 10 million won on my honeymoon and a total health check-up for my parents in both families.  

I don't regret it. I thought about my wedding ring until the end, but I'm glad I didn't!  

  

Now my newlywed house is a rented one-room.  

When I got married and came into this house, I had nothing to do with marriage.  

It's necessary to live together. I bought only what was considered one by one. A wardrobe, a nice blanket or something.  

At first, they were weekend couples, and they had some time left to sign their own room.  

I was thinking of taking the time to sign a honeymoon.  

After living, I was more satisfied than I thought, so I just sat down.  

No home, no car, no debt, of course.  

With a carefree mind, I can leave to achieve my dream of traveling around the world next year.  

Living on a small scale, I was able to save most of my income.  

Lack of money has also helped me to shake off the anxiety of living an unhappy future.  

Rather than making a lot of money in preparation for the future and old age,  

I realized that being satisfied with a small amount of money is important.  

Currently, the only big furniture in the house is a bed, two closets, a desk and table, two chairs, and a drawer.  

We're going to sell or dream all at a low price on our trip.  

I've been spending my husband's entire life on his own.  

I'll probably leave you two simple carriers of important documents and a few things you need at your home.  

I think I will be able to travel around the world freely with a backpack on.  

The courage to travel around the world.  

I know how to cherish the moment of the present, which will disappear if you don't enjoy it now.  

The realization that small habits that make life enjoyable are the "happiness"  

It's all thanks to minimal life.  

At first, minimal life itself was a goal and goal, so I focused on reducing and emptying things.  

You look inside yourself a lot.  

I realized what is the most important value in my life.  

I want to be healthy, free, and have fun.  

  

Minimal Life has set standards for judging what I need and what I don't need.  

The empty spaces and simple living give me leisure and free time.  

Then I spend my free time on living a healthy and enjoyable life.  

The biggest change I've ever made in my minimal life,  

I know exactly what I want.  

I became a person who can decide and move for what I want.  

By repeating countless pruning over the years,  

I've come to live my life to my heart's content.  

Excess time,  

surplus money,  

excess energy,  

Even if you use as much as you want every day, you never feel as lacking as before.  

A life so happy enough every day.  

If I had one wish,  

Time flies, and I want to travel around the world quickly :-)  

Our one-room newlywed house is small but cozy and nice.  

My husband's wardrobe for the fall/winter season.  

My summer wardrobe.  

It was taken last year, so there are about 10 fewer than this now.  

Save my allowance for two nights and three days.  

A trip to Japan, pretending to be a free woman alone.  

It's all my luggage. Thanks to my minimal life, I can also travel simply.  

I put all my luggage in this shopper bag and went home.  

It's the only study at home, and it's my personal space.  

Most of the books have been disposed of and left over.  

Rather than having hundreds of books in possession, now I borrow them from the library,  

I read a lot more books.  

Empty out a lot of high heels that we spent most of our 20s together,  

These days, I only wear comfortable shoes.  

When I get back from my trip, I'd like to have at least one good shoe that's about 3cm long.  

A small bathroom that cleans with a shower every day.  

What's she doing in that tiny sink? Her mother kicked her tongue.  

This is my small and precious kitchen.  

  

the whole range of tableware  

Two bowls of cold noodles and a glass are all I bought after getting married.  

I had a lot more than this when my husband lived alone.  

I've cleaned the kitchen and emptied everything except what I needed.  

  

Every Monday, I wash my pillow cover.  

Replace the blanket cover and mat every month.  

What about Minimal Life?  

I couldn't afford it. I only wash my blanket when my mom does it.  

I'm going to finish this article with a picture of my fall wardrobe that will be back soon.  

I always hope to live a simple life,  

When life forms or directions change,  

My minimal life will change, too.  

One day, you might be living a life of praise for McSimul Life rather than minimal life.  

I'm just trying to find and maintain the best ways to make me happy now.  

May all be happy with minimal life :)
