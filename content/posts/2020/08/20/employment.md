* I am now publishing what I wrote last November.  

My life is quiet. I don't know if you're going to ask back, "What's so quiet about a busy life with a child?" What I mean by quiet means is a life where socially dynamic and enterprising looks have disappeared.  

I wanted to live as a cool professional woman, so I became a mother. In fact, this sentence is wrong. Actually, I wanted to be a mother. Now I want to live as a woman who works again.  

Indeed, when and how that life will come to me.  

As I wrote in the article, "He cries," I recently came to Seoul with my husband for an interview. My husband had two interviews on the same day, and they were just a short distance away, and it was a busy day, including a second interview and a written test, which was possible because the first interview was in order. The place where I took the second test was later accepted after one more final interview and I came to work for the first time this month. The first main interview was the final interview, but the final presentation was a little late. So, he was notified of his acceptance in the last few weeks, and his husband resigned from the agency where the announcement was made late.  

I went to an institution for an interview. The list of 31 applicants was clearly visible when I looked at those who passed the document screening process. You're interviewing all 31 people? To the extent that the term "document screening" was overshadowed, every single applicant seemed to say to come to the test, which made me feel a little different from other places.  

My ruined interview period is as follows.  

On the morning of the interview, I waited waiting for my turn. When we went from waiting room 1 to waiting room 2, they told us to sit at the meeting table on one side of the office, so we sat in groups of four to five. Civil petitioners who came to see the head of the agency soon rushed in. I've been asking him to meet me for a long time, but he said that the department in charge is continuing to pretend not to know and asked me to meet him today. It seemed to be a gathering of old artists in the region, and they were angry with the idea that the agency's support and cooperation ahead of any event were quite different from what they expected, and that it was different from supporting other organizations. They had to prepare for the interview, but their heads were noisy in the scuffle between the civil petitioner and the staff. The chief of the department in charge came out to take care of them, but words that were not collected and appeared to be excuses made them even angrier. At this rate, personnel officers moved us to another waiting room.  

Finally, it was our turn and all four members of our group entered the interview room in unison. Five interviewers to four applicants had a conversation. Listening to the interviewers' questions, I felt like I didn't look closely at the cover letter and my career. I thought it would make no sense for them to read and understand all 31 documents. Of course, I thought that I would choose a candidate who stands out.  

After finishing the interview, I came to the waiting room to pack my bag, and an applicant (appeared to be a strong candidate) who entered the interview room with me asks the human resources manager.  

When will the acceptance announcement be made?  

Probably, it'll take about four to five days. And the notice will be sent by text message.  

I saved it in my head. After four or five days, and texting.  

When the recruitment notice was announced in the first place, I decided to make sure to check the text messages for four to five days after the interview, as I said in October.  

Various text messages made my heart tremble. Oh, what if it fell? Do you think it's a successful text message? For a week, I couldn't get into brunch at all. The focus was only on that, the acceptance announcement. It's been a week since I had an interview, but I haven't heard from you. Why is the presentation so late? When I was getting tired of the news that wouldn't come even if I waited, I logged on to the website just in case. There was no announcement of acceptance. When my husband looked at the list of recruitment boards, he said, "The old recruitment notice disappeared," and said, "Maybe it disappeared before we checked." Then, I was able to check the contents of the announcement by using Naver's page-keeping function.  

Those who passed the exam are 13 times. It wasn't me.  

I should have planted an apple tree.  

The rejection didn't feel too bad. Thirty-one people, I wondered if they would have come, and I thought that there would be one or two people better suited for the job than me. But the problem was the thought that my week just flew away. If I had to empty my mind and live my daily life, and even if I had passed a place where I didn't have any courtesy to the candidates, what kind of movie would I have waited for the announcement of my acceptance? It couldn't be so wasteful to lose time focusing only on it. I have decided not to do such a foolish thing in the future.  

Of course, the final announcement of acceptance should have been made by text message at the same time as the agency, which confirmed the receipt of documents and announced the successful applicants through its website and text message. That's how I wanted to ask.  

One part of my challenge to become an office worker ended like this.  

I present my application and imagine myself drinking Kimchi soup. No, so, where should I decide on my house when I go to work? Is it okay for children to adjust? Would it be better between my husband's commute and my commute? I have to ask my mother to take care of my children after they come home, but it shouldn't be too far away to come. Various considerations delve into one's mind.  

Then you realize. Oh, why are you thinking about valid things first? You can think about it then. Adults say, "Is it any good to hold onto something that doesn't happen before you think about it?" and "Did you get any taller just because you're worried?" One part of the woman's struggle to get a new job is to tie the knot like this.
