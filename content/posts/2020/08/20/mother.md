The morning sickness lasted until around six months, and in the meantime, there were quite a few days when my husband stayed at home during pregnancy, leaving several business trips.  

She didn't take care of her because she worked anyway.  

Still, it was because I thought it would be better to stay at home and meet my friends more often than to be alone at home during my husband's absence.  

However, even though I wanted to go to my parents' home due to morning sickness, I wanted to come back to my house soon because I was uncomfortable looking at my mother and son, my younger brother.  

My mother was always embarrassed by my son, but it was often hard to understand the attitude that was completely different from mine. At that time, the younger brother was preparing for a police officer, and the mother was always nervous not to offend her son, who was about to take an important exam.  

It was hard to understand how the mother washed the rice, saying, "Wait a minute, I'll make you a new meal soon," to her son, who was complaining about the smell of the refrigerator.  

Even when I saw my sister, who was at home for a while due to morning sickness, saying, "Go back to your house," my mother just said, "You have to endure it."  

It's always been that way. I didn't stop making money even after I got married after the college entrance exam, and even though I didn't hesitate to make harsh remarks, saying, "Unfortunate family history played a part in my life," I was a mother who gave up pork belly even at midnight because she was worried that her younger brother might get tired after a month of serving.  

Even the exercise equipment delivered to my house was given up after pretending to assemble it, and I finally whined and completed it.  

Looking at the younger brother, my mother only told me to go in, saying, "He can't hold his hands because he looks like his father."  

At first, I wanted the child in my stomach to be a "son."  

It was so hard to live as my first daughter that I didn't want to burden my children under such a burden.  

He also made a firm commitment to himself, 'if the first was a daughter, I would never have a second.' I didn't want to let my child go through as much discriminatory love as I did.  

The moment I heard the word "Princess" in obstetrics and gynecology, I felt like my heart was falling down a notch. Can I raise a daughter who hates my mother so much? Can I be a good mother? Countless question marks flooded in like waves. Then he stood in front of an uneasy heart and made a resolution.  

'I won't let you feel lonely, baby. I don't know anything else, but I'll fill your heart with chubby, without wrinkles. I'll make you as cheerful as you want without looking.'  

Over time, the belly swelled to the point where I could realize that the belly was the size of a mountain.  

Finally, I started to have a cold labor pains from the evening of my birthday. The next morning, Jin Jin-tong came to the hospital and informed the parents of both families.  

I asked my husband to come when both families gave birth to babies, but the mother, who heard about the labor pains, ran a distance of three hours and crawled to my hospital.  

It was the beginning of misery and trauma.  

Even before giving birth, the mother and I had agreed to come if we had a baby, but the reason for breaking the promise was somewhat absurd.  

His friends said that his mother had to go when his daughter gave birth to a baby. Of course, it's not wrong, but it's only true in normal mother-daughter relationships.  

Apparently, she really came to be faithful to her role as a mother rather than to worry about me.  

You think I'm too twisted? If so, please read this story more.  

The labor pains, which began around 7 p.m. the previous day, did not make progress until the next afternoon. Even though it was already over 12 hours, the uterine door was only 3 centimeters open, and I was already exhausted because I endured labor pains in minutes intervals.  

In the first place, I chose the obstetrics and gynecology clinic to overcome labor pains only through the communion between my husband and I in a quiet atmosphere. So I waited for the slow progress without using a facilitator, but as soon as my mother opened the door of the hospital room and came in, the desire for childbirth I had drawn collapsed.  

Once she bought a full bag of bread, she began to release all kinds of bread in front of me, telling my husband to eat them.  

I was thankful that my son-in-law was worried about being hungry to protect her struggling daughter, but I was the one who hasn't been able to drink water properly for 12 hours.  

I thought I wasn't the one who cares about my mom again.  

What was the standard of priority for a mother?  

As time went by, the pain got worse, but when she was in despair when she was told by a nurse who had an earthquake, she began to chat in earnest.  

On a rainy day, the road to the hospital was slippery and foggy, and the story of his grandmother who was fighting a disease at the time, gossip about his grandmother's excrement at the hospital, the birth of his friends' daughters, and even his own childbirth continued nonstop.  

I was worried about my mother. A man of no malice, just like him by nature. Until the day she gave birth.  

I'll just give birth and let you know, why didn't I stop him? It was too late to regret.  

He's not screaming. These days, I like giving birth to a lot. She was in labor in her own room, and at that time, the mothers shouted so loudly. Maybe it's because he got an injection, but he's not screaming. It's fresh play compared to then. fresh play  

If I could scream, I would have scored a hundred more goals. I would have been more comfortable without my mom.  

She's holding her teeth because she can't breathe well when the mother screams.And I've been trying my best not to show my weakness to my mother, and I've been in labor for 24 hours now, and I've been "fresh playing God.  

I wanted to yell for you to leave right away, but I didn't want to ruin even my birth process by fighting with my mother. I was lying on my back with all my strength and turning away from my mother, but she didn't stop talking to me in the back of my head.  

And I said to my friend who called because I was curious about the news that she had gone to see the baby.  

"These days, it's fresh play. Fresh play. It's quiet and not screaming."  

After 30 hours of labor, I was completely drained. When the mother, who was constantly chattering, started dozing off in her guardian bed, and the nurse, who couldn't see her, said, "I'd better go home and stay, right? The child is so out of the picture," he said, and went to my house.  

Then around 9 a.m., the day after the labor pains began, the mother returned just before the child came out. My mom saw me crying because I was tired.  

"Now it's real. It really hurts."  

He stroked his hand, saying.  

Did he say it out of pity? I'm sure so. I'm sure you didn't mean to tease me.  

After squeezing out the baby's milk power and giving it three power, the child finally burst into tears. After 38 hours of labor, I was breast-feeding my child for the first time and had a wonderful moment of childbirth (fortunately, only my husband could be with me in the final stages of childbirth).  

And the mother, who saw the baby crying loudly, left without even seeing me serve a glass of seaweed soup, as if it had been done. The parents-in-law, who arrived at the hospital almost in time for their child to come out, seemed quite embarrassed by the appearance of their mother-in-law, but it was nothing new or surprising to me.  

Thirty-eight hours of childbirth memory still remained a half-and-half memory of a mixture of wonder and nightmares, especially the mother's "new play" remarks, which came as an anger of the same intensity. Someday I really wanted to get an apology from my mom.  

By the time the child's birthday was almost over, while talking to his mother on the phone, the story came out, and I was half joking and half serious.  

"You're the one who called her "newspirit" when she gave birth to her daughter. You're going to apologize to me one day, aren't you?" and I was furious.  

"What would I say because I'm afraid of a kid like you?"  

I was just saying it because the facilities and situation were so different from when he gave birth to his baby, but do you keep it in mind?"  

'Was it so upsetting, I was short-thinking. I didn't mean it because I was thinking about it,' he said. Maybe it was too easy to solve. It's not that, but I could have buried it if I had shown signs of being sorry. Surprised by her shameless mother's attitude, words that I had kept inside poured out.  

My mom ruined every important moment of my life. Not at the meeting, not at the wedding, not even at the birth of a baby.  

Then you laugh when your grandson is born, do you cry? People laugh and chat at the funeral. Why would you go sit there and shut up?  

Of course, when your daughter is in labor, your mother may say, 'Shin-seon-nori' next to you.  

The intention of the word can be understood by yielding a hundred times.  

However, the mother is angry at her daughter, who said the words hurt her feelings, comparing the birth to a funeral.  

No matter how much I make a fuss and cry and sneeze, no matter how much I yell for you to look at my heart. My mother only covered her eyes and ears and got angry.  

"I'm doing this because you want to break up with me. You don't have to live without it!"  

Finally, my mom hung up the phone first.
