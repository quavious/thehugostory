Her face looking back at me was full of spring sunshine. It's already been two hours. I was swimming hard in the sieve bed, table, and bookcase, attracted by her hand.  The moving date has been set for mid-October. There was still about two months left, but the wife's mind was very busy. I thought about how to decorate my new house. Naturally our conversation shifted from children to directors. My wife wanted to change everything new this time. It pursued a simple, luxurious interior that reflected the fine exterior of the white tone and the current trend. Of course, the stuff to be filled had to be new.  Actually, when I first saw the house I was going to move to, I thought there would be nothing much to repair. Although it is an apartment that is almost 10 years old, I thought it would only be necessary to replace the wallpaper and the floorboard because it was so clean and well-used. I snuck out a story to my wife, then sensed the chill and stopped. Already the wife's mind was after all the decisions were made. I just remembered my wife, who was about to get married. At that time we were placed before two choices. A small individual worthy of investment in the Seoul metropolitan area was a villa, a basic plain outside. The wife initially chose the latter, but then switched to the former after receiving advice from her in-laws. When I saw the house for the first time, I felt disappointed, though I didn't show it. As if to compensate for his feelings, he was eager to choose furniture and home appliances. On weekends, I was attracted by my wife's hand and went around the department store diligently. "Honey. Isn't this bed too luxurious? The design is antique, and really soft. Right?"
