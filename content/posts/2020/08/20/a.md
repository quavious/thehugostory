From the rainy morning, I drove my car to a private garage. The official service center came to the place where the dealer introduced it because it would take more than a month to visit even if it was registered immediately.  Fortunately, it wasn't as big as I thought it would be (of course, the specified cost was incurred without fail) by lunch. As I went up to Seoul, I recalled the six years I had spent with this friend. Now I'm doing this on a regular basis, but I was just young and strong the day I first came out (although I still run well now).  

a connection that began with foolish ideas.  

After nearly four years of driving, the Korean gasoline midsize sedan, which used to ride in the past, had to be dangling from the steering wheel (a.k.a.) even after 1.3 million per hour at high speed, and its fuel economy was almost as high as a large gasoline sedan when driving in the city. At that time, he often drove long distances, so there was no reason for him to change his car. To be exact, however, these circumstances were a trigger for me, who was craving imported cars at the time. Now that I think about it, I'm sure I didn't think there would be any "meaningful" changes if I changed it to an imported car. Eventually, the car, which had no major problems with driving itself, became a "waste" that had to be disposed of through my "distorted circuit."  

Since early April, he has been visiting exhibition halls of several brands to find out about the new car. After a two-month search period, the car was decided to be the current car, and one day in early June, it was taken over from the exhibition hall and brought home. I still can't forget the smoothness of the ride, which was like cotton candy on a rainy day (may have just felt like cotton candy).  

To put it to the conclusion in advance, my idea of changing cars and raising my status was completely wrong. Even the upper segments of the same brand, as well as the much more expensive luxury cars of other brands, were spotted right and right after crossing Hannam Bridge, Seongsu Bridge, and Yeongdong Bridge (of course facing south), trying to look as rich as " And, of course, buying a car doesn't actually make you richer. Being rich and looking rich is quite different, and I tried hard to ignore the obvious. Also, cars are just cars and have little or no effect on human values. It's a laughing stock for the whole town to change cars to be a charming man.  

So, was it a regretful event that changed the car?  

repay with solid performance and practicality  

It is simply luck that foolish choices bring good results. There aren't many cases like this in my life, and I've been incredibly lucky. The new friend was simply excellent at the task of the car. In detail, it is as follows.  

Performance  

Even if the HUD had a speed of well over 160 in high-speed driving, there was no shaking of the body. Even in cornering, more than 140 were easily passed. The softness of the brakes and accelerators was beyond description. In addition, when driving long distances, the company realized the enormous dignity of diesel at the price of oil, which is only half the price of gasoline. Some people who denigrate diesel say it's a dragon or a cultivator, mocking the unique engine noise and vibration of the body. Of course, I respect the tastes of people who like a quiet ride. However, the basic and essential function of a car is to run, stand and run well. He has no complaints or regrets about the performance so far because he has a firm view on the matter.  

Design  

There is no need to mention terms such as C pillar and Hope Meister kick. I'm not envious of Coupé if you're looking at a long bonnet and a short trunk. Although there will be pros and cons for each individual, the design of the three German sedans is definitely more attractive than that of Korea. No matter what model it is, it is slippery and slim, and looks like it will run well. On clear days, the heavy and refreshing color of the Imperial Blue, similar to the color of cobalt, stood out more.  

Convenience  

It was not necessary to press the button with your finger until the end to close the passenger window. It was a different world just by having a rear camera installed as a base, as I had only used a parking sensor. Since there was a HUD, there was no need to look at the instrument panel with a slight (dangerous) head down. On a clear autumn day, I could open the sunroof and get some sunshine. More than anything, the oppressive power was a trunk that opened with feet. For a while, he repeated putting his feet in and out of curiosity.  

At that time, my new friend became my alter ego and traveled around the country together. With you, I ran vigorously (because nothing really happened) and guided me to a new and wider world. As much as the increasing mileage, I came to understand the Republic of Korea in a more three-dimensional way, and I could look deeper into people's hidden desires than before. Inside, I experienced a happy moment with someone and I was able to indirectly experience a wider world of knowledge and culture while driving while listening to YouTube and podcasts.  

Which car should I take next? And what kind of person will I be?  

Since the mileage is long and the model year is old, there are often things that require unexpected maintenance like this one. Since the warranty period has ended, the cost of repairs is also very high. It's still a little early, but since it can't last forever, I sometimes think about which car to choose next. One of the inconveniences I felt while driving around was that the car was a bit big and bothered about parking. And I've thought for a long time that there won't be any problems with my kidneys and bones even if I ride a car a little smaller than now.  

In the meantime, he recently left the repair to the official service center and rented a car in the segment one step below the car. I've always thought that this size would be enough, but when I rode it myself, three to four adults were enough. The previous model used the stigma of being a solo car, but I thought it would not happen anymore because of the wider body and interior space. It's also a new car, so it's been going really well, and it's incredibly quiet. It was such a pleasant ride that it made me feel like screaming. This model is highly recommended for people who have purchasing power and frequently ride long distances.  

Electric cars are expanding their power with Tesla, but it will take some time to settle down in ordinary people's daily lives (although the world is changing quickly, it is not necessarily like that). According to the prediction of "2020 Wonder Kiddy in the Universe," which aired 30 years ago, we should be in a helicopter taxi now. Even if it's time to buy the next car, electric cars won't be popularized, and even so, I think it's going to be a bit expensive. Therefore, a smaller size of diesel is likely to be the most likely option for now that there is good feeling and trust in diesel. Of course, gasoline or hybrids will be fine if there is less work to drive long distances.  

And most importantly, next time, I'm really going to say,
