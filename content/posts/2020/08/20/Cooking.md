No. 2 likes a television show called Three Meals a Day. It is also an interesting point for the cast to show the harmony of the Tikitaka fantasy, but I especially like how Cha Seung-won makes a variety of dishes as if he were insignificant. His cooking has a different charm than other chefs who cover other cooking programs. The rough shape really makes me feel like I'm cooking for a living.  

No.2 is that good too.  

The first player, who was fiddling with his cell phone and glancing at the program once in a while, throws a word. Of course, it may be just lip service. Still, I feel proud of No. 2`s shoulder. In fact, No. 2 is because he is proud of his cooking skills and pride. On the other hand, she has no self and will to do a pretty decoration, so her cooking is always a "survival dish. Perhaps the reason why I was attracted to Cha's cooking was because of his homogeneity.  

After five years in college, No. 2 realized for the first time that he had his own talent. Even if you don't read the recipe book while heating it up, or use various cooking tools to measure carefully, you can finish the results that you don't have to be eaten. It would have been better if I had been taught the secret recipe of my mother, who is famous for her skill, but learning was enough over my shoulder. That's because my passion for cooking was just that much. The degree to which you can make some of your favorite foods quick when you need them. He may have had a talent, but he didn't fit in. It was literally cooking skills for survival.  

After the wedding, it was largely due to her mother-in-law that No. 2 gave up cooking for the first time at three meals a day. My mother-in-law couldn't believe that a young couple ate breakfast. Even though I've told you many times that I'm going to work after breakfast, the conversation went on to say that we lie in good faith so as not to worry you. It was not forced to cook rice, and it was a simple advice that one should fill one's hunger with rice cakes or bread. It was never a bad intention, but I felt somewhat unfair because it was No. 2 who managed to lift a spoon by sitting in front of the table every morning while embracing the blind No. 1. For No. 2, which was late to work due to the nature of freelancers, setting up the table before No. 1's rush hour was quite difficult. After reaching an agreement, No. 1 and No. 2 decided to replace breakfast with rice cakes, bread and fruits as their mother-in-law said. It was a year and a half after getting married.  

Lunch was a situation where everyone worked and settled down, but dinner was mostly at home. Therefore, the steam rose in the couple's kitchen every evening. It was pregnancy that prevented this smooth flow. Thanks to No. 2 suffering from severe morning sickness from the early stages of pregnancy, the couple's kitchen was shut down from time to time. Surprisingly, the morning sickness continued steadily until the day before giving birth, and the two relied on side dishes that served a large number of meals from both families (only after childbirth did we know that the morning sickness was caused by a problem with the gall bladder). After giving birth, most of them left the kitchen except for preparing for No. 3 baby food because of back pain. Instead, I used a side dish shop near my house. It was true that the operation rate of the kitchen dropped significantly, although it was not that they did not cook at all.  

However, he needed a new decision as he started his first parental leave. The excuse for not cooking at home has disappeared, and there is a reason why it must be done.  

First, the only part that could make a definite change in terms of expenditure was food costs. There were realistic limitations to reducing fixed costs. Stopping spending that could be stopped for the time being, and some consumption decided to scale back, but there was no way that there would be any remarkable results. However, it is expected that unnecessary expenses will be greatly reduced if people cook with their own ingredients instead of using delivery apps or visiting side dish shops.  

Secondly, 'healthy food' was needed for the health of all half-white families. One of the purposes of paternity leave was to restore No. 2's health, and the most basic effort that can be practiced at home was to cook healthy food. Food was also a very important factor for No. 1 who had been eating out every lunch hour on his way to work, and No. 3 who had to grow up for a long time. All members of the family needed a good meal.  

When the above rational decision was made, No. 2 made a scary remark without realizing it.  

While we're all together, I'll only put healthy things in our mouths!  

To begin with, No. 2 kept this promise very well. One of the top five people who ate out or ordered food for delivery during the 150-day journey is to eat. The semi-white families have become healthy, and the Engel's index for their families has dropped noticeably, which has also greatly helped households.  

But it's easier said than done. The "Three Meals a Day" mission, which appears like a regular customer in the twilight couple's problems, was held before the eyes of No. 2. There are three "painting complexes" in this house that someone used to refer to as "Samsik" in self-help jokes. Cooking three meals a day for the three samsiks was like spending half of the day in the kitchen. Furthermore, I had to separate the adult's and the child's dishes, which made me more anxious. It was bigger than I thought to think about what to do every time.  

Nevertheless, No. 2 happily entered the kitchen at most meals. Although a little tired, showing off my cooking skills has become a rewarding daily routine. Thanks to the reliable sponsorship of No. 1 and the lovely charm of No. 3 that hovered around the cooking No. 2 like a guardian angel. Perhaps aptitude is controlled a lot by the surrounding environment. When I was living alone in my early 20s, I didn't want to do anything about it, but it could be a wonderful thing to do!  

The joy you feel whenever you open your mouth to eat, or whenever you chew your cheeks. It was also very exciting to observe the growth of No. 1 and No. 3, which grew so rapidly that the morning and lunch were different from the day's blurry face. No. 2 said, 'My babies are happiest when they have food in their mouths.' came to understand the feelings of parents who used to live with their mouths shut. Maybe even Cha Seung-won's heart is to put delicious food in the members' mouths.
