Pigeons are not the only ones with homing instincts. In fact, our bodies also have a strong homing instinct. The fact that the body hates rapid change is evident in orthodontics and diets. Orthodontics and dieting are a product of patience and have something in common that it is difficult to maintain a perfect state. For braces, it takes at least a year to more than two years for the teeth and gums to move together. Patience is a must.  

I pulled out a total of four teeth, including a wisdom tooth, to match the teeth that went behind the other teeth and uneven teeth. A device was placed on the surface of the teeth to pull out the birth teeth and fill the remaining spots, and each month it was pecked to fill in the gap between the teeth. New pain is a bonus every month. When the device is pecked, the gums and teeth scream. After a few days, you get a little used to it, but when you get used to it again, the pain eventually continues throughout the calibration.  

a straight tooth that has been squeezed and squeezed for two years They take off the device they shared for a long time and pat their smooth teeth with their tongues to enjoy the joy. But it's not over until it's over. Maintenance must be worn after orthodontic treatment. The upper teeth had to wear dentures that could be detachable, and the lower teeth had a retainer attached to the inside at all.  

She has an aesthetic even tooth, but her tongue touches the bottom retainer and her pronunciation of "s" leaks. I also got Roh's "th" pronunciation. But when you remove the retainer, it goes back. Two years is not a short time, but more time is needed for the teeth to remember their current condition.  

The body tries to maintain its present condition.  

The same is true of the body. She went on an excessive diet with a month left before the first interview of a flight attendant in her mid-20s. It didn't matter if you were hurt. It was a diet to reduce the number of scales, which is only good to look at. I ate some cabbage and two spoons of black beans in the morning and went out to the park for breakfast and dinner to walk quickly.  

He is 168 centimeters tall and has a target weight of 50-52 kilograms. On the day of the interview, he gained 53 kilograms on an empty stomach. It was the result of a month of intense loss of moisture, muscles and a little fat. Enjoying the sense of freedom that the interview results were over without paying attention, he came home and ate galbi right away. The appetite, which had been suppressed for a month, burst into laughter with the juices of the meat. The most delicious galbi of my life was not two plus Korean beef, but the ribs I ate after a month of dieting.  

Then something amazing happens. I weighed myself right after I ate, and I think I gained 2kg. Believing that it was a temporary phenomenon, I ate as I did before dieting, but I started to gain weight rapidly. Finally, in a month, he returned to his weight of 60kg before losing weight.  

The reason why a month's diet has become "Roamitaburi" is because he overworked his body without eating too quickly. There was a mission to slim down by the set date, but in fact, you have to lose weight slowly to diet healthy and maintain it.  

Some experts say it is appropriate to lose 1kg a month and some 3kg a month. As if to laugh at this, losing 30 kilograms a month is said to be a trend on YouTube recently. It's a huge number, but it's not a problem to lose it. It's not easy to maintain a weight you've lost.  

I'm really on a diet.The earring ends and starts.  

The real diet begins after you achieve your goal. Why would a hundred say it is difficult to maintain a hundred? It's because of our body's homing instinct, our first disposition to go back. Why do people fail to lose weight? Because I can't live on a diet for the rest of my life. In order to lose weight by cutting back on eating, one apple in the morning, one egg at lunch, and one protein shake in the evening until death.  

The ghost who died after eating said it looks good. I don't want to live like this. So how can I lose weight and maintain it?  

Dieting also requires habits.  

The body recognizes the habit of repeating itself regularly as its own. If you keep a certain rule for a long time, you have the habit of keeping it. For example, for three years, you've had breakfast and lunch at a set time and a set amount. If this person eats more than usual on weekends and feels a little fat, it can quickly go back to its original form. If there is a pattern that has been maintained for three years, it is because the body tries to remember it and go back. If you eat as much as you eat again, this person will soon regain his weight.  

Of course, it's not easy to eat regular meals at a set time. You can't always eat a certain amount, but having a regular pattern helps. In my case, not for diet, but for a more comfortable diet, the amount of food I eat and the consumption of high-calorie foods gradually decreased.  

I have a fried egg for breakfast. It's because I feel bloated when I eat a lot, so I don't feel comfortable on my way to work. And I go to work and eat energy bar or dog fruit every day.  

I go to the gym near my company for lunch. After five minutes of cycle + 40 to 50 minutes of muscular exercise, he returns to work and eats lunch at his desk. Originally, my mom packed me a lunch box like fried rice, but thinking about what I could easily eat in my seat, I ended up eating eggs, potatoes, cherries, cherry tomatoes, and soy milk packs. Eating an egg and a potato usually keeps you hungry. Then when you feel hungry again a few hours later, you take turns eating cherry and cherry tomatoes.  

I eat a common meal in the evening or eat out if I have an appointment. I like to cook chicken, so I often eat jjimdak, and I also eat various kinds of jjukumi fried chicken, bibimbap, jjamppong, and tangsuyuk.  

It is lighter and more efficient when exercising on an empty stomach than when the stomach is full. A month after exercising on an empty stomach at lunchtime, I lost 3kg. Losing weight was not the goal, but building muscles, but I lost weight. It would have been more effective if we had thorough diet, but we didn't want to go against what we wanted to eat. Three times a week, as a result of exercising at lunchtime and adding rules to life, muscles gained and weight lost.  

If you can't keep eating as much as a bird feed, let's make a habit out of it. Patience may be necessary, but if you maintain regular eating habits for several years, your body will adjust to them.
