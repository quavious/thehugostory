Many things change after you become a mother. The time to wake up changes and the food, thoughts, and appearance changes a lot. When you become a working mother, your life cycle also changes to child-centered. Weekdays belong to the company, weekends belong to the child, so not every day belongs to me. You've changed my whole life like this, and I can't believe it'  

Most mothers develop "self-reflection" disease after having children. No matter how good I am, I can't get rid of the feeling that I'm always lacking. Not only this, but after I become a mother, I start to get symptoms that I usually don't have. Let me introduce you to some of the morbid symptoms I have felt since I became a mother. Some have fully recovered, but others have not yet improved.  

1. Suspicious disease  

I don't think I deserve to be a mother.  

When I raise a child, I gain a "momma-grade suspicion" about whether I am qualified as a mother. The first suspicion, motherhood. There are differences between people, but maternal love usually does not occur immediately after giving birth to a child. I used to blame myself for not being qualified as a mother because of maternal love that didn't happen immediately after giving birth. I was not ready to be a mother, but I felt so sorry and reprimanded myself for having a child in the world.  

Motherhood is the mysterious mind and ability of a mother. How can this mysterious feeling be created when only a child is born? God doesn't give children so easily. bear a child and die a deathMotherly love is what builds up as she grows up. So don't blame yourself too much for not having a motherly love. Time will heal naturally.  

Recently, however, the "momaja-gum disease" has recurred. I skipped the first dental checkup, so I went to the examination a little bit later, and five cavities were found. I can't get out of the shock easily and I'm frustrated by reprimanding myself for not getting the first checkup. After work, she returns home and tears up as she looks at her sleeping child. I'm sorry, Mom, I don't think I deserve it. This symptom requires long-term treatment.  

2. Search bottle  

I wanted to be nice to you.  

When a child is sick or curious about his or her development, he or she searches the Internet first. These days, mothers are highly dependent on searching, such as whether 10-month-old babies can eat honey and 23-month-old children can use a few words. And at the end of the search, there is a 'mom cafe.' The words of an experienced person who came out of the Mom Cafe and was placed in a similar situation begin to be trusted and soon be considered the correct answer. There are some examples that actually help.  

But a search engine is a disease that you really have to watch out for. A bad example is the once controversial cafe called Anaki. This is a cafe where oriental medicine doctors forced them to raise their children without taking medicine, not vaccinating them, with the good word "immune." As a mother, I want to catch a straw when my child is sick. If that's how I can stop my child's cough, I'd like to follow suit if my child's skin disease could get better. Mom is so frustrated by the search that she has no choice but to rely on the search again. I want to be nice to my child.  

I also have a high dependence on search. While there are unfortunate events such as Anaki, searches are often useful. When a child is sick late at night, shows abnormal behavior, or wants to know the standard of development, the portal contains a lot of information. Search sickness is a good way to raise a child better, so let's just be careful to trust such reckless information as Anaki.  

3. Comparative disease  

Why is it only our child slow?  

  

  

Each child's growth varies widely. It's okay to be a little shorter than your peers, but you seem to be slow in speaking. If you don't have health problems, let's admit that body or language development is different for each child and don't compare. Even if it's a little slow or a little different, the child is growing up doing his best.  

Mothers with more than one child do not seem to have the symptoms relatively, but they seem to be common among mothers who are new to their mothers. When my child was very young, the other kids were already this big and developed, but my child is in place, right?I made a lot of comparisons with that idea. But as time goes by, my child is growing at his own pace, and although there is a bit of a lag, I don't worry too much. Isn't there such a saying among old adults? Stay healthy! If you're healthy, that's it.  

4. Anxiety disease  

I have all the other kids.  

As a society centered on competition and comparison, the culture and habits of educating children change. In the midst of these changes, mothers' fearsome mom-cafes are forced into several cultures without my knowledge. If you don't go to Munsen (Cultural Center), you feel like you're not doing cultural activities for your children, and expensive dioceses like "The Complete Works" or "Seifen," which have hundreds of books at home, are basic. Without this preparation, we begin to feel anxious about missing the golden time of our child's brain growth.  

Maybe this much preparation really helps to enhance the child's creativity. However, it should be recognized that it is not a required value. I also used to buy all the good things out of anxiety. But looking back, we didn't lag far behind our peers just because we didn't have such an environment. In addition, if the child doesn't want it, it's over. It just becomes pretty trash.  

That's enough for parents and children to enjoy and be happy. A child can feel and learn just by drawing on a sketchbook with his mom and dad at home, or by kicking a ball in the playground. Even if the environment is not well-equipped, a child can grow up in a good enough direction with parents. I would have it if my child wanted to, but I decided not to have any anxiety about getting anything because I was agitated. Now you can look at it as "perfect."  

5. Obsession  

a disease that never existed in a relationship.  

I have a disease that I've never had in a relationship. Under the name of love, one begins to obsess over a child. I want to do everything the child wants and wants to do. If a child wants, he or she tries to do what he or she wants without any control. Then I ask the child. "Do you like mom or dad?"  

Maybe it's because it's my first time being a mother, but I get quite obsessed with the child Beyond the illness caused by being a mother like the previous four, they are now becoming like lovers. I was worried that she would cry and go crazy looking for her mother at the daycare center. I thought it was a lie to say that the daycare center teacher did not cry at all and had fun. I'm so upset if you don't look back at me when you call the child. If I try to do more things that I don't want to do, I get mad. However, when my mom says that she likes it the best in the world, all her anger melts away.  

There are many other symptoms of obsession, but I'm afraid I'll look like a weird mom. For a mother, the obsession with a child seems to be a very difficult disease to fix. Â He is obsessed with his child every day with longing for love and looking at his mother. My mom has never had a hard time with obsession when dating, and this little, lovely little boy makes her heart suffer. If you have a girlfriend, it'll be fixed. No, it's gonna get worse!  

They used the word disease, but in fact they are pretty "minds" for children. After becoming a mother, the affection for the child grows day by day and there is more to do for the child to do. It's just that we've grown up, so let's take it in a good mood even if we have symptoms. Many mothers on Earth are doing well enough now, and I have no doubt that they will do well in the future. I hope today will be a day that gives more love to my child than yesterday.  

My mom's existence is enough. I support all mothers in the world :-)
