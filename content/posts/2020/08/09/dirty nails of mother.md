"Honey, I'm going to babysit you. Go out for a minute."  

It had been four months since I left the house. I heard that bears become humans after eating mugwort and garlic. On the contrary, he must have thought, Now I have to get him out of the way, looking at me who had lost a human skeleton during that time.  

When I was about to leave my husband alone, I felt like I was leaving my colleague on the battlefield. You said the couple were comrades. It was heartbreaking to think of my husband's sloppy back when he was feeding a child milk alone and whining, but his fingers have already sent messages to his friends.  

Sister, let's go get your nails done.  

'Nail art? Does it make sense to decorate my nails right now? Some say so. Why are you putting so much effort into your fingernails to cut off? Someone says this. Flowers are luxury because they wither. I needed luxury.'  

I was a mess at that time.(Not much has changed now) I couldn't even wash up before my mother came, and I couldn't remember when I had a decent meal. The black hair had grown to ears because she had not dyed her hair since she was pregnant, and her face, which had never slept more than three o'clock at a time, was grey. I gained 13kg after I got a child, but I lost just 3kg like a lie after giving birth. It weighed exactly as much as the baby's weight and amniotic fluid. The rumor was no different from what I heard, so I was almost goosebumps.  

I haven't even washed my hair for three days, and now I'm getting my nails done. I was dumbfounded at myself, but my fingers searching through Instagram were excited. #Nail #Nailstagram #As half of the fun of this month's nail travel is planned, half of the fun that nail has seems to be at that moment. We were snooping around and thinking about what to do this time. The time when the remote control is being held by me. It's not enough to meet a friend, but more than 3 hours to go to a cafe alone. I did my nails.  

After that, I went out to do my nails at least once a month. I went to the shop to watch TV, buy coffee, and chatted with the hair designer. So this is how you put air in your nostrils. It was a breath-taking time. That's how I was breathing, like a goldfish poking on the surface of the water and returning to its place.  

"What's with your fingernails? I guess you don't have a drop of water on your hands. No, the first thing you do when you get home with your fancy nails is to wash your baby bottles. With these shiny fingers, I wash baby clothes, change baby diapers, make baby food and feed them all. I'm going to do everything in the future and do well like I do now."
