"My sister, she's the first and last woman of my life. Help me."  

"Ha... you're still young. What about your parents?"  

"So you can help me, huh? You're the only one I trust. I..."  

I can't forget the day when my younger brother said he had his first girlfriend. To a 23-year-old who always looked young in my eyes... I fought a lot when I was young, but I got closer with my social life and my younger brother going to college. When my younger brother came to pick me up at the end of the day, I watched a movie and ate and enjoyed a date. We were famous as close brothers and sisters even among friends. I was curious that such a younger brother was a woman I loved, but I was disappointed.  

My younger brother's girlfriend is my mom's friend's daughter now, Olke. The first time the family knew about the opponent, they were all panicked. Was it because of the cold look that you couldn't find any freshness? I was still young, so I thought I'd break up with him. But his only purpose was "marriage." The younger brother, who was only a child, entered his first love and marriage at 24.  

I've known him since middle school, but now that he's a family member, my family was careful that Olke would be uncomfortable. The in-laws never said, "If your brother wants to be happy, your daughter-in-law must be happy." They always emphasized the story with their mother and waited until they felt comfortable. She was pretty enough to live well without any problems, and that's enough. That's what it's all about.  

It was early summer last year. My father was rushed to the university hospital with high blood pressure and cerebral infarction. His blood pressure was also a problem, but he had to stay in the emergency room for four days because he didn't come out of the hospital room. On behalf of her mother, who had no situation, her younger brother took a nap in the chair and stood by her father in the emergency room.  

Mom headed home with a steady step. How hard it must have been for a mother to have an empty seat in her father's house? I wanted to run to my mother right away, but I was only paying attention to my son under the pretext of my grandson's illness. Having a daughter is nothing. I couldn't call my mom directly because I was sorry, but I was sorry.  

"How's Dad doing? I feel so bad because only my mom is home alone."  

"Don't worry about my sister. My wife just packed up to go to my mom's house and left. I think she'll cry a lot if she's alone in a big house."  

"Really? Olkega? It must have been hard for you to do that."  

"I know. Mom's moved."  

I, who had never wished for anything from Olke, was tearful at Olke's sudden behavior. How did he decide to spend the night alone at his mother-in-law's house? I made a phone call right away.  

"Sister, don't worry, Mother. I'll be by your side."  

"Thank you very much.You're so daughter-in-law than your daughter-in-law. Please take good care of Mom."  

The day when Olke's sincerity, which was always silent and unexpressed, was conveyed. Thanks to this, my family became more sticky and could endure the long father's rehabilitation silently. What would I be like? If my father-in-law was in bed and my mother-in-law was alone, would I have taken my luggage right away?'It wouldn't have been easy.  

"Okay." Is there anything you want to eat? I'll do it for you."  

  

Thank you for being my family. "Olke is a better daughter-in-law than her daughter." She is willing to be with her in the presence of her heart. When Olke had a hard time, I promised that day that I would be by her side as a reliable older sister, not her sister-in-law.
