In order to draw a picture in a short period of time, I took out a dusty exercise field.  

I found where the pencil holder was in order to draw in a short time.  

I thought about what to draw in order to draw in a short time.  

Think for a moment.  

When I couldn't think of something I wanted to draw, I thought it would be better to see it in front of my eyes.  

Above the screaming line, I heard Sharp-sim's agitation.  

I can't hear the calm piano that was deliberately turned on. I just hear Sharp's grunts.  

The hand that was taking shape soon stopped.  

I didn't like it because it was a line that was struck in a long time.  

Think for a moment.  

Turn the paper over to the next sheet.  

When I tried to draw it again, it seemed that my hand was already stupid.  

What to draw  

Think for a moment.  

Soon, I cover the book and leave it with Sharp in the corner of my desk.
