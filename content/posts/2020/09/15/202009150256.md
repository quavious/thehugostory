This morning, the auxiliary battery and the wireless earphone  

Devices that couldn't be charged during the weekend  

I had a frustration of not listening to music on my way to work.  

To rest properly while resting and start over  

I had many things to charge besides myself  

This is what I realize.  

Even when I get older  

If there's someone around you who will keep nagging you,  

So you take your life  

If I can keep it charged,  

Your happy daily life will not stop.
