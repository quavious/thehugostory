I went out like going out after a long time.  

It's messy, but I put on makeup and put on loose clothes, and I thought about leaving a lot of pretty pictures if I could leave every moment.  

Weight still didn't come back  

My mind seems to be slowly returning to my daily life.  

The mood also softens.  

Meeting familiar and precious friends is one of my favorites.  

You are not limited to just one kind of story, and you need at least one friend who can share all of my stories in order to live like a person.  

Luckily I have it.  

Looking at my difficult times as they are  

I am so grateful and grateful to my friend who supports me.  

Next week, you will be struggling for several days because of the strong medicine, but thank you for the day when you were able to spend a normal and peaceful day without getting sick.
