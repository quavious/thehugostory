Everyone lives their daily lives. People who have to go to work, students who have to go to school, and people who have to work hard live their daily lives. We had no choice but to eat outside, drink coffee to cheer up, and drink to comfort each other...Everyone lives their daily lives. I meet my friends and eat together, eat coffee and dessert, watch movies, travel somewhere in Korea, and celebrate each other. I go to a big mart to shop and shop. I envy people who are healthy, not afraid, and live their daily lives. If we were on our way to work, we might have lived our daily lives with a more comfortable mind. I would have had to feed her and drink coffee in the teachers' room. Now, the last person who gave the lecture was also online, so we didn't have a chance to do any external activities. As a result, it seems to be becoming more and more isolated. There is no one on our Daecheong Lake promenade.
