Like the dark sky obscured by dark clouds, everyday actions hidden behind the corona were neither ordinary nor natural, time lost in the swamp of illusion, time lost in front of the virus wall, and daily life was tied up.Through the glass walls of the vast body that tries to save the lonely fight of the one who tries to stir the world, Majubo is running to the place where the old mother and her children's heart has changed in their heart, and the daily living health that has been deeply moved, and where the bright light shines through the nose or walls.
