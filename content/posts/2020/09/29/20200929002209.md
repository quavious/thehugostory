I think you've made an excellent name at brunch.  

When I was just naming, I thought that the words and feelings were pretty, so I started using the word'drawer'...  

Or is it brunch's amazing foresight...  

Writing is piled up in the drawer.  

Someone may say'Wow~' but it is not.  

It is literally building up.  

The dust is about to sit white because it can't be accumulated.  

Once inside the drawer, unpublished articles are piled up like things that do not appear.  

Did brunch predict this situation and used the word 'drawer'...  

(If it was the artist's 'refrigerator', the situation might have been more serious. This is a reflection, but sometimes artifacts are found in my refrigerator.  

He has fallen into the swamp of infinite repetition of self-censorship and cannot publish the article.  

It is a drawer row again to see if there are any articles that can be used to remove the accumulated dust and resuscitate cardiopulmonary.  

I'm not alone... I'm sure everyone is...  

Even today, I give myself a timid comfort in front of the monitor.  

Ah... After publishing this article, you might regret biting the tip of your thumb alone.
