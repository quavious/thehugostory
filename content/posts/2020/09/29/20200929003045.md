It is steamed seafood.  

After taking pictures, it looks more delicious.  

Mawfish, giant octopus, and virtue are piled up like mountains.  

The executioner who lives in the neighborhood next to Ilsan bought it.  

Execution is five years younger than me.  

Still, since I have courtesy of the village, I treat it like a shame.  

Even when I get in my wife's car  

The executioner takes the back seat and I sit in the passenger seat.  

Execution does so, and sits at the back seat.  

Such execution was an old KBS'entertainment PD'.  

Is the old man  

Sometimes, whenever I eat out, I think it is natural to execute watering.  

I, of '80 Idol,' are sometimes happy as Yo Tau.
