There are many moments I like while drinking matcha, and this is one of them.  

When a little water is added just before powdering. Just before the tea and water are still mixing.  

Sosanwon-Unhak purchased because it is easy to drink with farm tea.  

In fact, I think it's better to drink with spur. It's so soft...  

It's a taste that feels like you know the reason why the cloud luck is in the name, and it has such a sense of relaxation and comfort.  

I couldn't capture the moment perfectly, but there is such a fantastic moment.  

When the sun comes in as you start rowing the lane. Very shiny.  

If you write a phrase such as miracles or magic in everyday life, you want to use it when drinking tea.  

As the tea scent spreads out, it's not too late to pick up the lane and start stirring,'Oh this looks delicious. When you think,'Get delicious,', when the sun sets and the drainage season and the tea water sparkle, you seem to be saying that it will be today.  

And when it's delicious as if you got a definite answer.
