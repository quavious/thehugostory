I imagined the sea and where I could go later. I didn't think of possible places. Then, looking at the department store, from the underground parking lot to the entire building, there is no one sill that is difficult for strollers to cross.  

You must be in that position to realize that there are factors that cause certain groups to gather in certain places. Involuntarily... Even the sidewalks I walked every day became a little dazed that it was full of thresholds.  

When I only had to carry my body, my view was definitely narrow... Is it necessary to experience various roles in order not to be awkward? It would be nice if the barriers were lowered even in ordinary public facilities where various groups pass.
