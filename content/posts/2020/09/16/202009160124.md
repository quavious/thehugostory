The daily routine of wearing a mask has already entered its half year. At first I didn't know it would last this long. It is already summer. In preparation for the hot weather, a splash-blocking mask came out, but it seems that the fog on the glasses is an unsolvable problem. When will I be able to walk the streets with my bare face?
