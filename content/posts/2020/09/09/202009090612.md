These days, the word "everyday life" feels really precious.On weekdays, I commute by public transportation, hang out with my colleagues for lunch, and meet my friends in the evening to talk about a beer.On weekends, I go grocery shopping, visit my elderly parents, celebrate my acquaintances, go to church and worship. It's so new to me that my daily life was so natural.  

This city we enjoy, home and workplace, family and colleagues, friends and neighbors. My self-reflection, which was so indifferent to me, is flooding in, for those who have not shown their presence and have always been close to me and never considered their preciousness.Not only do we realize that public infrastructure, such as health care, education, transportation, but we also realize how much of our daily lives have been consumed, drank, stored and slept through the efforts of many people.Today in 2020, when the world feels that we are living the same time, I don't know if we can allow the small virus to coexist in our daily lives, but I think we should try to reflect on each other's preciousness and re-organize our daily lives.
