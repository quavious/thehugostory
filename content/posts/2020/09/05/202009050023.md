Put the scone you made recently on your own flower painting plate.  

Cherry tomato marinade is perfect for eating.  

"Morning I Made," which is not a grand dining table but feels wonderful.  

After eating the scone, I can see the words and recharge my body and mind.  

White flour mixed with butter, yellowish, milky, patted, and baked appropriately.  

The scones that you eat because of the dryness of your throat.  

Put a cup of cool white milk just taken out of the refrigerator.  

The base that has become rich after adding wine to the cherry tomato marinade. I'm glad I put in the wine.  

I feel happy when I swallow my throat.  

Next time, I'll add more onions and honey. Don't peel it.  

One spin of olive oil just before eating it.  

I look at the plants by the window while listening to a simple breakfast.  

The new geraniums show the red light of summer and wither and unfold.  

Paprika seeds planted on the same day grow differently.  

When will the small bud clear the eggplate stage?  

When you're making that day's coffee with a mocha pot, you can hear birds singing over the window.  

Hooray like a paprika sprout - spread out.  

The gentle wind, sunlight, and the cute sound of birds give a pleasant ventilation to the dampness of the mold.
