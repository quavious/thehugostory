The evening breeze is slowly changing, and more houses are opening windows instead of air conditioners to let in the wind, and the season is coming for the sound of crickets. And our daily lives are slowly going back to the past.  

My mom and aunt trim the peppers harvested during the day to prepare for the liquid, and my dogs doze off after playing all day, and I knitting beside and sometimes helping dinner. Talk about how hot and humid it was today, listen to the explanation of the dinner menu and talk about the admirable puppies.  

There is no father going to look after the puppies with the sound of big dogs calling his dad and a cup of coffee, but life is still going around a long way and slowly returning to its place again.  

When the cool wind comes, I'll be busy making a beautiful garden again. Now, I don't have the best colleagues, and sometimes I'll be lonely.
