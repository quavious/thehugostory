I have a lot of business trips on Monday, so I go to the countryside early in the morning.  

When you leave the house, it's still dark and nobody's dawn.  

After I crossed the dark road alone, a big truck passed by.  

In that short moment, it's nothing.

Even if you can't see the morning,  

"There's nothing strange about it."  

a day without a thing

I live my life day by day, and for various reasons, including my expectations, my role in society, and my beliefs, I start the morning with that expectation to be a "special day."  

However, when I see a heavy truck passing by in front of the crosswalk I came across, and I, and we, at any time, think that the "normal things" can disappear, and the morning that is given for granted every day, may not.  

If that happens, the world could become "one line news" and "just unlucky" and "one thing that's not weird." It's a flash in my mind at that moment.  

"Nothing Happened" became another opportunity to feel grateful and precious.
